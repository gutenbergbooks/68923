<h2 class="pix50"> AUTHOR'S NOTE </h2>

<p>
I and my four companions left the Solovetsky
Islands (called in this narrative the "Solovky," the
name by which they are commonly known) on
May 18th, 1925, and crossed the frontier between
Russia and Finland on June 15th. But it was not
until eight days later that we reached Kuusamo
and ascertained positively that we were in Finland,
so that our journey lasted thirty-six days.
</p>

<p>
As I had supposed, I found that outside Soviet
Russia the whole circumstances in which those
transported to the Solovetsky Islands are compelled
to live (or, it would be more correct to say,
to die) — the whole life, regime, conditions of
labour, food, and the other internal and external
characteristics of the Solovky, were absolutely
unknown.
</p>

<p>
The secrecy which enwraps the Solovky is quite
comprehensible. The Soviet papers, concealing
the grim truth from Russian readers, pass the
Solovky by in complete silence. Foreign newspaper
correspondents are not allowed to go there.
There had not been, till we got away, a single case
in which a prisoner had succeeded in escaping
across the frontier, whereby the public opinion of
Europe could have learnt the truth about the
Solovky.
</p>

<p>
Providence thought fit to rescue me, by a
miracle, from this place of torment. And I count
it my most sacred duty to tell the world what
I saw, heard and went through there.
</p>

<p>
These notes, of course, make no claim either
to literary qualities and beauty of style or to
exhaustive completeness. I look upon them as
the testimony of a fair witness who speaks the
truth and only the truth. And if my testimony is
recognised as worthy of consideration, and is
accepted as a part of that gigantic indictment which
the Russian nation, the whole of humanity,
history and God will without doubt bring forward
against the Soviet power, I shall consider that my
duty has been discharged.
</p>

<p>
In confirmation of my claim to have been, to the
best of my power, impartial in my exposition of
the facts, I may say that when I showed these notes
to my comrades who escaped with me they were
of opinion that, in my description of the regime in
the Solovetsky Islands, I had in many cases been
too moderate.

</i>
</p>

<p>
Before proceeding to my main task — an account
of the conditions in the Soviet prisons in the
Solovetsky Islands — I should like to dwell briefly
on the period of my life which immediately
preceded my transportation to that place. I think
that this period is of more than merely personal
interest. As far as I know, the punitive activities
of the Soviet power in the Caucasus after the
crushing of the armed anti-Bolshevist rebellion
there have not found a place in any book of
memoirs.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the final retreat of General
Denikin's forces I was in the ranks of the
Caucasian Army (on the Tsaritsin front). The
disaster to the Volunteer Army compelled us all to
take refuge in the mountains. Keeping touch all
the time with the attacking enemy, our cavalry
brigade reached the river Terek, where it was
dissolved. The most reliable elements of it
crossed the frontier of Georgia, at that time still
an independent State.
</p>

<p>
In Georgia, the members of the brigade who
were fit for service were incorporated by Keletch
Sultan Hire in a cavalry regiment. Its duties
were to execute raids on the Soviet rear and throw
it into confusion, to destroy roads and excite
rebellion against the Bolsheviks.
</p>

<p>
The raid into the Kuban planned in the summer
of 1920 by the staff of General Wrangel, who was
then in the Crimea with his army, gave Sultan Hire
the idea of sending us also to the Kuban in the
hope of inciting the Cossacks to rebellion. In the
Kuban, we took part in the retirement of the
invading troops to the Crimea, the raid having
considerably outgrown its original dimensions.
The bold plan of bringing about a rising did not
succeed. We were dissolved once more.
</p>

<img src="images/page15_map.png" alt="Map of the Caucasus" />

<p>
In exceptionally difficult conditions, surrounded
by troops of the Red Army, we formed a new
detachment under the command of Colonel X
(I cannot give the colonel's name; he is still
carrying on guerilla warfare with the Soviet
power in the Caucasus). Our detachment, despite
its small numbers, waged warfare of a kind with
success, and we were beginning to think of operations
on a larger scale, when we unexpectedly lost
the support on which we absolutely depended and
counted; the famous "national rebellion" took
place in Georgia. In reality the country was
occupied, almost without resistance, by regular
troops of the Red Army. Our detachment retired
fighting through the wild mountains to Batoum.
Here part of it was broken up and turned into
larger or smaller bodies of insurgents, part left for
Anatolia.
</p>

<p>
I made my way to Ajaristan. Thence communication
was established with Trebizond, where
Y lived; his name, too, I cannot give in full for
the reason stated above. Until the autumn of
1922 we and Y organised frequent raids on the
Soviet Russian frontier.
</p>

<p>
Then, as now, the unofficial direction of the
whole insurgent movement in the Caucasus was in
the hands of the well-known Colonel Tchelokaeff.
Thanks to extensive help from the population,
which sympathises with the "Whites," and to his
own bravery and skill, the Bolsheviks have found
Tchelokaeff quite uncatchable.
</p>

<p>
I know for a fact that the "Gruztcheka"
(Georgian Tcheka) and "Zaktcheka" (Trans-Caucasian
Tcheka)<a href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> have repeatedly attempted to
buy him; they have repeatedly offered him huge
sums in gold simply to leave the Caucasus. They
even offered him a villa in any country in Europe
he liked to name. The elusive colonel, however,
rejected these proposals with disgust, and is still
carrying out surprise attacks on one or another
stronghold of the Soviet power in the Caucasus.
</p>

<p>
Between Tchelokaeff and the Communist
authorities of the Caucasus a peculiar treaty
exists. The colonel's family has for several
years been confined in the Metekh<a href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> at Tiflis,
a prison notorious for the cruelties practised
there. The Bolsheviks, of course, would have
shot them long ago, had not Tchelokaeff captured
and hidden in a remote spot, as hostages, several of
the most prominent representatives of the Soviet
power.
</p>

<p>
When the colonel heard that his family had been
arrested, he sent the following letter to the
presidential body of the Georgian Tcheka:
</p>

<p>
"I shall send forty Communists' heads in a sack
for each member of my family murdered by
you. — Colonel Tchelokaeff."
</p>

<p>
So the Tchelokaeff family and the Communist
hostages are still alive.

</p>

<p>
In November, 1922, in honour of the anniversary
of the October Revolution in 1917, the Council of
People's Commissaries of the R.S.F.S.R.<a href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> (Russia
then still lived under that pseudonym) extended a
full amnesty to all opponents of the Soviet power.
This amnesty, which was signed by the flower of
the Communist Party, formally promised complete
oblivion of every manner of offence committed by
White Guards of all ranks and categories.
</p>

<p>
I cannot say how I, who knew better than anyone
the value of Bolshevist promises, who had waged
a life-and-death struggle with the Soviet power
for so many years, could have believed in the good
faith of people who always lie. I paid for my
unpardonable stupidity by my sufferings in the
Solovetsky prison. May my fate serve as a
warning to other credulous people!
</p>

<p>
On April, 1923, I presented myself at the
Tcheka offices at Batoum. I was interrogated by
an examining judge remarkable for his youth — an
impudent lad of seventeen. The detective service
in Soviet Russia is brilliantly staffed! When he
had totted up my "offences" in detail, the boy
Tchekist concluded his interrogation with the
jeering cry:
</p>

<p>
"Ha, we don't use kid gloves with fellows like
you!"
</p>

<p>
Nor did they. When I referred to the formal
phrases of the amnesty, the examining judge roared
with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Take him to the cells. They'll show him the
amnesty there."
</p>

<p>
They did.
</p>

<p>
I will not describe in detail my moral and
physical sufferings, the blows, the insults, the
attempts to extract information from me by
<i>provocateur</i> methods, which I endured while in the
custody of the Batoum Tcheka. Suffice it to say
that I was finally taken to be examined at two
o'clock in the morning. They again went through
my biography for the last few years with the
greatest exactitude, and proposed that I should
confess everything and name my principal accomplices,
ten in number (the number was given quite
correctly). Persuasion was exchanged for abuse,
and abuse for revolver shots over my head to
intimidate me.
</p>

<p>
I denied my guilt, and refused to name any
accomplices. I and three other men were taken
into the yard to be shot. They killed one prisoner
two paces from me. The second likewise was shot
dead. The third fell, covered with blood. They
yelled at me:
</p>

<p>
"Now it's your turn!"
</p>

<p>
I stood beside the bodies of my companions in
imprisonment. Almost touching my head with
the muzzles of their revolvers, the Tchekists
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Now confess!"
</p>

<p>
I was silent. For some reason they did not kill
me. Probably my life was still useful to them in
some way.
</p>

<p>
I spent a few days in the prison of the Batoum
Tcheka. Then they took me to the Trans-Caucasian
Tcheka at Tiflis; its headquarters were
in the Sololaki quarter, in the centre of the town.
As regards cruelty, there was no difference between
the regime there and that at Batoum. The
president and omnipotent master of the Trans-Caucasian
Tcheka was at that time the well-known
Tchekist Mogilevsky,<a href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> who was killed not long
ago in an aeroplane accident.
</p>

<p>
Blood was flowing in streams in the Caucasus.
The Communists were taking a triple vengeance
on their prisoners for the murder of Vorovsky in
Switzerland, the insurrection in Georgia and Lord
Curzon's ultimatum. In the countless prisons of
the Caucasus thousands of people were being
slaughtered daily.
</p>

<p>
The Caucasus has not yet been finally pacified
by the Communists, and at the time of which
I write the whole country was ablaze with civil
war. Insurgent bands burst into the towns and
hanged all the Bolsheviks. The latter replied by
intensifying their already merciless reign of
terror.
</p>

<p>
One day the rebels descended on the "Kursk
settlement," close to Vladikavkaz, and, among
other things, drove off the herds belonging to the
Soviet. A pursuit was set on foot, headed by the
celebrated executioner, the Lett Shtybe, President
of the Gpu<a href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> of the Mountain Republic. The
rebel band went into hiding in the mountains,
taking the cattle along with it, and could not be
traced. The Tchekists succeeded in discovering
and surrounding in the mountains only one rebel
leader.
</p>

<p>
The mountaineer, with a precipitous wall of
rock behind him and plenty of cartridges in his
pocket, withstood an attack from several squadrons
of Communists for several hours. One of his
well-aimed shots killed Shtybe himself. Although
several times wounded, he killed eleven more
Communists. At last he fell mortally wounded. In
his rifle, which his cold fingers held close to his
face, not one cartridge was found; he had fought
to the last. He was tied to a horse's tail and
dragged to Vladikavkaz.
</p>

<p>
The executioner Shtybe was buried with pomp
and ceremony in the Pushkin Square at Tiflis.
The death of this rascal was made a pretext for
reprisals against the prisoners.
</p>

<p>
The cowherd in charge of the beasts which the
insurgents had driven off into the mountains was
a boy, deaf and dumb from birth, and clearly half-witted.
This imbecile creature was ordered by the
Tchekists to identify, from among all the prisoners
in the gaols of the Caucasus, "those concerned in
the murder of that unforgettable champion of the
happiness of the proletariat, Comrade Shtybe."
</p>

<p>
The presidential body of the "Gortcheka"
(Tcheka of the Mountain Republic)<a href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> did not
trouble to ask itself how we, who had been in a
Tcheka prison at the time of Shtybe's death and
long before it, could have been concerned in his
"murder." We were drawn up in two ranks.
If the cowherd stopped in front of a man, uttered
an inarticulate sound, or simply smiled foolishly,
it was considered sufficient proof that the man who
had attracted the half-witted boy's attention had
"murdered the unforgettable Comrade Shtybe."
He immediately received the order, "Two paces to
the front!" and a bullet was put through his head.
</p>

<p>
Several dozen men were killed in this manner
before my eyes. Then, walking along the second
rank, the cowherd stopped before me. Death
seemed inevitable. But, apparently, the public
prosecutor of the Mountain Republic, Toguzoff,
who was walking behind the cowherd, and who had
interrogated me only the night before and knew
perfectly well that I had absolutely nothing to do
with Shtybe's death, felt a momentary prick of
conscience, and led the cowherd on just as he was
distorting his countenance in an idiotic grimace
before me.
</p>

This public prosecutor is a characteristic figure.
Kazbek Toguzoff, an ex-officer, in 1917 carried on
a desperate struggle in the Caucasus in support of
the Provisional Government, demanding the
dissolution of all the Soldiers' and Workmen's
Councils by armed force and the immediate
hanging of all Bolsheviks. By unascertainable
methods he entered the Communist Party, and
to-day he is still hanging men — but now anti-Bolsheviks!

Prince Mukhransky's Resolve — The Metekh — In the
Hands of Sadists — A Shunned Locality — "Shooting
Nights" — A Biter Bit.
</i>
</p>

<p>
Among the thousands of persons imprisoned in the
gaols of the Trans-Caucasian Tcheka at the same
time as myself were fifteen officers, among them
General Tsulukudze, Prince Khimshieff, and
Prince Mukhransky, whose brother was married to
the daughter of the Grand Duke Constantine
Constantinovitch. They were all charged with
organising a mythical counter-revolutionary plot
and being concerned in the Georgian rebellion of
1923, and after prolonged, torturing examinations
were sentenced to be shot.
</p>

<p>
Prince Mukhransky resolved not to sell his life
cheaply. He succeeded in getting hold of a large
nail, found in the room. When, on the night
appointed for the execution, the door opened and
a party of Tchekists headed by Schulman,
Commandant of the Trans-Caucasian Tcheka,
known as the "Death Commandant," entered to
fetch away the condemned officers, Mukhransky
flung the nail as hard as he could into Schulman's
face, aiming at his eyes. The heavy nail broke the
executioner's nose. Schulman groaned with pain.
At once an incredible noise arose. The whole
prison was awakened by cries and shots. The
room was filled with smoke. All the fifteen officers
were killed on the spot by the escort. The
prisoners in other rooms were ordered to wash
away the streams of blood.
</p>

<p>
The executioner Zlieff, plenipotentiary extraordinary
in Ossetia of the Gpu of the Mountain
Republic, used to force the muzzle of a revolver
into the mouth of the prisoner he was examining
and turn it about so that it crushed the gums and
knocked out teeth. My cell companion in the
prison of the "Gor-Gpu" was subjected to this
torture. He was an old Ossetian, who was accused
of the following offence (to quote from the indictment
itself):
</p>

<p>
"The accused once walked past Tchelokaeff's<a href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
door."
</p>

<p>
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
After a few weeks I was transferred to the chief
prison in the Caucasus — the Metekh<a href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> at Tiflis.
As at the present day, the Metekh was used in
1923 as a place of detention for political prisoners
only; ordinary criminals were lodged in the
Government prison. There were in the castle
2,600 "White Guards," including a large number
of Georgian Mensheviks.
</p>

<p>
Inhuman reprisals were carried out methodically
on these defenceless people — I saw many old
men, women and children. Once a week — on
Tuesdays — a special commission, consisting alternately
of members of the Trans-Caucasian Tcheka
and the Georgian Tcheka, sat in the commandant's
office in the prison and drew up a list of victims,
paying no more regard to the degree to which, in
each case, proof of guilt existed than to the voice
of humanity. The whole personnel of the castle,
the "Zaktcheka" and the "Gruztcheka," was
filled with sadists.
</p>

<p>
Every week, on Tuesday nights, from sixty to
three hundred persons were shot in the prison.
That night was veritable hell for the whole Metekh.
We did not know who was marked down to be
shot, so everyone expected to be shot. Nobody
could get a wink of sleep till morning. The
ceaseless bloodshed was a torture not only to the
prisoners, but to people living in freedom outside.
All the streets round the Metekh had long been
uninhabited; the population of this quarter had
abandoned their houses, unable any longer to listen
to the shots of the executioners, the shrieks and
groans of the victims.
</p>

<p>
The Tchekists in the Metekh were always
drunk. They were regular butchers. Their
resemblance to butchers was heightened by their
habit of rolling up their sleeves to the elbow and
walking through the corridors and cells, sometimes
tumbling to the floor, drunk with wine and with
human blood.
</p>

<p>
On "shooting nights" from five to ten men
were taken from each room. The procedure of
reading out the list of those doomed to die was
drawn out by the Tchekists to an average minimum
of a quarter of an hour in each room. There was
a long pause before each name was read, during
which the whole room shivered with terror. Even
people with strong nerves could not withstand such
torture. On Tuesday nights half the prisoners in
the castle sobbed till morning came. Next day no
one could eat a morsel of food; the prison dinner
was left untouched. This happened <i>every</i> week.
And prisoners from the Mountain Republic
who came to the Solovky in 1925 told us
that it was still happening then. Many people
could not endure the prolonged nightmare and
became insane. Many committed suicide, in every
conceivable manner.
</p>

<p>
While I was in the castle a well-known Tiflis
Tchekist, Zozulia, a Cossack from the Kuban, was
placed among the prisoners to act as an <i>agent
provocateur</i>. This executioner, in a comparatively
short space of time, had shot over six hundred
persons with his own hand — a fact which he did
not deny. At last he was recognised and killed by
the prisoners.
</p>

<p>
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
I spent four months and a half in the Metekh,
and prepared myself for death every Tuesday.
</p>

<p>
Then began an endless series of journeys and
fresh prisons. From the Metekh I was transferred
to the Government prison at Tiflis, thence to the
"Timakhika" prison at Baku, where I spent a
fortnight, then to the Tcheka prison at Petrovsk
(three weeks), thence to Grozny, and from Grozny
in "Stolypin trucks," specially constructed for
prisoners, to Vladikavkaz. Everywhere was the
same total suppression of human personality, the
same torture by nocturnal interrogations, starvation
and blows, the same lawless, indiscriminate
shootings.

<p class="pix40"> <i>
Finally "Amnestied!" — The "Shpana" — A Lucky
Escape — Classification of Prisoners — Madame
Kameneff's Protegees.
</i>
</p>

<p>
At last, on November 30th, 1923, i.e., seven
months after I had been "amnestied" by the
Batoum Tcheka, the examining judge of the
Vladikavkaz Tcheka finally "amnestied" me in the
following terms:
</p>

<p>
"By order of the administrative exile commission
of the People's Commissariat for Home
Affairs, Citizen S. A. Malsagoff, having been
found guilty of offences against the State of the
nature contemplated by Clauses 64 and 66 of the
Criminal Code of the R.S.F.S.R. — Clause 64,
'organisation of terrorist acts in co-operation
with persons outside Russia,' and Clause 66,
'espionage for the benefit of the international
<i>bourgeoisie</i>' — is exiled to the concentration camp
in the Solovetsky Islands for a term of three
years."
</p>

<p>
I and several others who had been "amnestied"
were sent north by easy stages. The first halting-place
was Rostoff. Here I first met face to face
the so-called <i>shpana</i> — the ordinary criminals who
play so singular a <i>rôle</i> in all the Russian prisons,
camps and places of exile.
</p>

<p>
Robbers on a large and a small scale, burglars,
murderers, horse-thieves, coiners, vagabonds — are
flung in whole divisions from one prison to
another, serve their term or escape by bribing their
guards, but soon get into gaol again. Almost all
are completely destitute of clothing, always
starving, and covered with lice. The guards beat
them over the head with their rifle butts, they
murder one another with bricks wrenched
out of the prison walls. Completely bestialised,
wherever they go they gamble away their modest
<i>payok</i> (food ration) and their last pair of trousers
at cards. This loss they make good by robbing
newly-arrived prisoners belonging to the political
categories. The stolen things are sold through the
overseers of the prisons and camps, and the money
obtained for them is spent on drink.
</p>

<p>
On entering the room allotted to us in Rostoff
prison, I was struck dumb with consternation; we
were met by nearly a hundred <i>shpana</i> with
deafening yells and menacing cries. In a corner
sat five men of the educated classes, including a
colonel on the General Staff; the <i>shpana</i> had
stripped them naked in one night.
</p>

<p>
Luckily there were men among us who had been
through every imaginable experience. One of
them drew a chalk line on the floor, dividing the
room into two spheres of influence, political and
criminal, and shouted to the <i>shpana</i>:
</p>

<p>
"If one of you crosses this line, I'll kill him!"
</p>

<p>
He was a man of gigantic stature; the <i>shpana</i>
were intimidated. When night came, we posted
sentries on the frontier of our sphere of influence.
But for events taking this turn, the money and
other things which our relations had managed to
send us when on the way to Rostoff — by means of
substantial bribes to the guards — would have been
stolen from us.
</p>

<p>
From Rostoff we were sent to the Taganka in
Moscow.
</p>

<p>
In the Taganka prison a noticeable degree of
system prevails. There are separate rooms for
"criminals" of different categories. In Moscow
we made the acquaintance of the curious division
of all "criminals" by the Soviet authorities not
into two classes, "counter-revolutionaries" and
"<i>shpana</i>," as in the Caucasus and Southern Russia,
but into three.
</p>

<p>
The first group, called "K.R.", comprises
persons suspected of acts or propaganda of a
Monarchist or, in general, a <i>bourgeois</i>, anti-Socialist
tendency. In this comprehensive group
you may meet an ex-Minister and an ex-doorkeeper,
a young non-commissioned officer and a
general, a big manufacturer and an assistant in a
small shop, an ex-princess and her cook. The
Soviet authorities allot to the "K.R." group the
whole clergy <i>en masse</i>, without distinction of
Church, the whole of the educated and semi-educated
classes, all merchants and all officers.
</p>

<p>
To the second group, the so-called "politicals
and party men," belong prisoners from the
remnants of the pre-Revolution Socialist
parties — Social Revolutionaries, Social Democrats,
Anarchists, etc. — which have not yet been merged
with the Communists.
</p>

<p>
The third category comprises the criminals
proper, the so-called <i>shpana</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Soviet authorities maintain this same
distinction in the Solovky and all the other concentration
camps and places of exile or settlement.
</p>

<p>
In the Taganka we were placed in a room packed
full of clerics. There were the Vladika Peter
(Sokoloff), the Archbishop of Saratoff, the monks
of the Kazan monastery, etc. Almost all were
accused of concealing church treasures at the time
when the Bolsheviks were robbing the churches to
satisfy the needs of the Komintern.<a href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> These
bishops, priests and monks, like us, were sent to
the Solovky.
</p>

<p>
In Petrograd, where we arrived at the beginning
of January, 1924, a group of twenty men, so-called
"Casino-ites," were placed in the same room as
ourselves in the "second passing-through prison,"
occupied exclusively by prisoners going on to some
other place.
</p>

<p>
Not long before a fashionable gambling hell in
Moscow for highly-placed Communists, called the
Casino, had been shut on the ground of too high
play, drunken orgies, immorality and debauchery.
The unofficial head of this honourable institution
was Madame Kameneff, wife of the President of
the Executive Committee of the Moscow Government.<a href="#footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
The Moscow Gpu, when closing the
Casino, did not dare to arrest the spouse of the
Communist Governor-General of Moscow, but the
whole staff of the gambling hell, headed by the
croupier Petroff, was sent to the Solovky for three
years.
</p>

<p>
These fellows were also our companions on our
journey to Kem. Subsequently the "Casino-ites,"
at the instance of Madame Kameneff, were sent
from the Solovky to a voluntary settlement in the
Petchersk region. Before our flight from the
concentration camp I heard that Petroff and Co.
were back in Moscow.
</p>

<p>
Convoys of prisoners are now sent north from
Petrograd once a week, on Thursdays. On one of
these Thursdays — January 14th, 1924 — I and a
large number of other "K.R.'s," "politicals and
party men," and <i>shpana</i>, left for the Solovky in
prisoners' trucks.

Conditions in Earlier Camps — The "White House" —
100,000 Shot — Mass Drownings — A Commission
of Inquiry — Survivors Removed to Solovetsky
Islands.
</i>
</p>

<p>
Until late in 1922, Kholmogory<a href="#footnote11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> and Portaminsk
performed the function now discharged by the
Solovky. When I reached the Solovky at the
beginning of 1924, I met a number of men, the
survivors of the "K.R." prisoners in the
concentration camps at these places. They had
been transferred to the Solovky in August, 1922.
I should like to state briefly what these men, who
had remained alive by a miracle, told me.
</p>

<p>
The concentration camps at Kholmogory and
Portaminsk were established by the Soviet
Government at the end of 1919. The people sent
to them from every part of Russia had to live
in hastily-run-up hutments. These were <i>never</i>
heated, even at the height of winter, when in these
far northern latitudes the thermometer often falls
to -50° or -60° Celsius (90 to 110 degrees of
frost Fahrenheit).
</p>

<p>
The prisoners were given the following ration:
one potato for breakfast, potato peelings cooked in
hot water for dinner, and one potato for supper.
Not a morsel of bread, not an ounce of sugar, not
to speak of meat or butter. And these people,
driven by the pangs of hunger to eat the bark of
trees, unable to stand from exhaustion, were
compelled by tortures and shootings to perform
hard labour — digging up tree-stumps, working in
the stone-quarries, floating timber.
</p>

<p>
They were absolutely forbidden to correspond
with their families in any way or to receive
from them parcels of clothes or food. All letters
were destroyed, food and other things sent were
consumed or used by the camp guards.
</p>

<p>
After the defeat of the armies of General
Denikin and General Wrangel, at the end of 1919
and 1920 respectively, captured White officers and
men and civilian inhabitants of the territories
wrested from the White armies — men, women and
children — were sent to Kholmogory, convoy after
convoy. And after the suppression of the Kronstadt
rebellion in April, 1921, all the sailors taken
prisoner by the Bolsheviks, about 2,000 in number,
were sent there. The remnants of Koltchak's
army, various Siberian and Ukrainian chieftains,
peasants from the Tamboff Government who had
belonged to Antonoff's bands, tens of thousands of
members of the <i>intelligentsia</i> of all nationalities
and religions, Kuban and Don Cossacks, etc. —
all flowed in a broad stream to Kholmogory and
Portaminsk.
</p>

<p>
The higher administration of these camps was
appointed by Moscow and carried out the instructions
received thence. The middle and lower
<i>personnel</i> consisted of imprisoned Tchekists, who
had been transported for too open robbery, taking
of bribes, drunkenness and other breaches of duty.
These fellows, having no one else on whom to
avenge their removal from their lucrative duties in
the Extraordinary Commissions of Central Russia,
treated the prisoners in the camps with indescribable
cruelty.
</p>

<p>
The assistant commandant of the Kholmogory
camp, a Pole named Kvitsinsky, was particularly
ferocious. This sadist-executioner has on his
conscience the horrors of the so-called "White
House," in the neighbourhood of Kholmogory.
The "White House" was an estate abandoned by
its owners, containing a white-painted building.
Here for two years (1920-22) shootings took place
daily at the direction of Kvitsinsky. The terrible
reputation of the "White House" was doubled by
the fact that the bodies of those executed were not
taken away. At the end of 1922 all the rooms of
the "White House" were filled with corpses right
up to the ceiling. Two thousand sailors from
Kronstadt were shot there in three days. The
smell of the decomposed bodies poisoned the air
for miles round. The stench, which never abated
by night or day, stifled the prisoners in the camps
and even made them faint. Three-quarters of
the inhabitants of the town of Kholmogory
were finally unable to endure it any longer and
abandoned their homes.
</p>

<p>
Without the slightest doubt the Soviet Government
knew of the horrors perpetrated at
Kholmogory and Portaminsk; it could not help
knowing. But, having an interest in the pitiless
extermination of their opponents, real and
supposed, the leaders of the Communist Party
confined themselves to washing their hands of the
whole business.
</p>

<p>
Executions were carried out at other places
besides the "White House." The Tchekists
used to come into the prisoners' enclosure and,
having marked down the destined victims,
point to one or another of the prisoners with the
words: "One — two — three. . . . One — two —
three. . . . "One" meant that the prisoner was
to be shot the same day, "two" that he was to be
shot to-morrow, and "three" the day after
to-morrow. This was usually done when a fresh
large party had arrived, and room had to be made
in the camp for the newcomers.
</p>

<p>
According to the evidence of eye-witnesses,
about 100,000 persons in all were shot at
Kholmogory and Portaminsk. There is nothing
astonishing in this figure, terrible as it is. For three
years on end these camps constituted the chief
prison of all Soviet Russia. To them, in addition
to the large convoys, were sent, from every place
in European and Asiatic Russia, all those whom it
was for any reason undesirable or inconvenient to
kill on the spot — for example, all those who had
been "amnestied" by local Soviet authorities.
</p>

<p>
The executioners of Kholmogory and Portaminsk
used another method of destroying their
prisoners: they drowned them. Of a whole series
of cases known to me I will mention only those
which follow.
</p>

<p>
In 1921 four thousand former officers and
soldiers of Wrangel's army were ordered to
embark on board a barge, and the vessel was sunk
at the mouth of the Dvina. The men who were
able to keep themselves on the surface by
swimming were shot.
</p>

<p>
In 1922 several barges were loaded with
prisoners. The Tchekists sank some of them in
the Dvina in sight of everyone. The unfortunate
passengers on board the other barges, among whom
were many women, were landed on one of the
small islands near Kholmogory and shot down with
machine-guns from the barges. Mass murders
were carried out on this island very frequently.
Like the "White House," it was heaped with
bodies.
</p>

<p>
Those who escaped being shot the Tchekists
hounded to death by compelling them to do work
beyond their strength. The prisoners in receipt of
the above-mentioned ration, among them old men
and women, worked all round the clock. It was
counted a piece of luck to find a rotten potato in
the fields; it was greedily eaten on the spot, raw.
</p>

<p>
When the Tchekists noticed that the inhabitants
of the region — Lapps, Zyrians and Samoyedes —
were throwing bread to the crowd of prisoners as
they passed their huts, they began to take them to
their work by another route, through thick forest
and marshes.
</p>

<p>
If a newly arrived prisoner was decently dressed,
they shot him at once, in order to get his clothes
sooner.
</p>

<p>
Early in the summer of 1922 a Kronstadt sailor
who, by chance, had remained alive escaped from
the Kholmogory camp. He succeeded in making
his way to Moscow, where he used his former
connections to obtain an audience of the "Vtsik"<a href="#footnote12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
(All-Russian Central Executive Committee), and
said to Kalinin:
</p>

<p>
"Do what you like with me, but turn your
attention to the horrors in the northern camps!"
</p>

<p>
At this time 90 per cent, of the prisoners had
already been done to death. Communist humanity
had been sufficiently proved, and the Vtsik,
exchanging anger for clemency, lent a gracious ear
to the escaped sailor's prayer. At the end of July,
1922, a commission started from Moscow for
Kholmogory to inspect the Kholmogory and
Portaminsk camps. Its president was one Feldman.
</p>

<p>
Feldman himself could not conceal his horror at
what he saw and heard at these places. He had the
camp commandants shot, and sent their assistants
and the rest of the <i>personnel</i> to Moscow, nominally
to be tried. All the Tchekists, however, were
pardoned and placed in positions of responsibility
in Gpu offices in Southern Russia. Fully understanding
that the "White House" and its scores
of thousands of corpses were a burden on the
conscience of Moscow, Feldman determined to
wipe out the traces of all that had happened there.
He therefore ordered the place to be burned down.
</p>

<p>
Feldman's commission had been empowered by
the Vtsik to amnesty the prisoners in both camps.
Only the ordinary criminals, the <i>shpana</i>, however,
received their liberty. None of the "counter-revolutionaries"
were amnestied.
</p>

<p>
In August, 1922, the remaining "K.R.'s" were
sent under a reliable guard from Kholmogory and
Portaminsk to the Solovetsky Islands, <i>via</i> Kem.

</p>

<p>
The "Solovetsky" concentration camp received
its name from the Solovetsky Monastery, founded
in 1429 by Saints Sabbatius and Hermann, while
Saint Zosima built the first church in 1436. The
island, seventeen miles long by eleven broad, on
which the monastery stands, is one of a group
known by the collective designation Solovetsky
Islands; there are, besides the principal island, five
other large ones — Ansersk, Great and Little
Zajatsk, Great and Little Muksalm — and a number
of small ones. They lie in the White Sea, at the
entrance to the Gulf of Onega, and close to the
western coast of the Archangel Government.
</p>

<p>
The Solovetsky Monastery, one of the most
ancient and most held in honour of Russian
monasteries, has long been noted for the peculiar
ascetism of the life led by its inmates, the
incalculable wealth of its churches and the large
number of monks in the brotherhood, which is
indicated by the fact that the number of boys sent
by their relations to the monastery for a year
reached in some years the figure of two thousand.
</p>

<p>
The monastery had, among other things, its own
tannery, iron foundry, paper mill, match factory,
saw mills, dozens of workshops of various kinds,
a printing works (the workmen were all monks),
a dock, a merchant fleet, and even a small navy
for the defence of its shores. The monastery's
infantry and artillery, consisting exclusively of
monks, were also designed to serve this purpose.
</p>

<p>
The first years of the Revolution affected
the organisation and economic strength of the
monastery only to an insignificant degree, lying, as
it did, to one side of the main road of Bolshevist
pillage. Even at the time when the British were
in these parts — it will be remembered that the
Archangel and Murmansk areas were for a time
occupied by a Russian anti-Soviet army, under
General Miller, and British troops — the monastery
still lived its old industrious life.
</p>

<img src="images/page54_map.png" alt="Map of Northwestern Russia, Showing the Solovetsky Islands" />

<p>
The Soviet power destroyed this highly cultured
advanced post of Russia in the Far North with
characteristic violence and cruelty. In the autumn
of 1922 all the wooden buildings of the monastery
were burnt. The Bolsheviks began by murdering
half the monks, including the Igumen of the
monastery; the remainder they sent to forced
labour in Central Russia. The treasures were
plundered by the first Tchekists who entered the
precincts. The decorations of the ikons were torn
off, the ikons themselves blasphemously chopped
up with hatchets for fuel. The bells were flung
down from all the belfries and the fragments sent
to Moscow to be melted down.
</p>

<p>
Besides a multitude of objects precious in a
religious and material sense, the Soviet Huns
destroyed treasures of immense historical value.
The Tchekists pillaged the library of the
monastery, which during the five centuries of its
existence had been filled with unique works. They
heated the stoves with rare books, old documents
and chronicles of the greatest antiquity. Finally,
the dishonest methods of the new management,
combined with the criminal plundering and
inexperience of the Soviet administration, ruined
the factories and workshops belonging to the
monastery.
</p>

<p>
The ancient building was reduced to a heap of
ruins. The Tchekists put up a barbed wire fence
round it. The half-destroyed Kremlin, or main
enclosure of the monastery, became the headquarters
of the "Slon."<a href="#footnote13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> All the branches of the
Solovky are under the direction of the office in
question, viz., the Solovky camp itself, the Kem
camp (on Popoff Island), the camp on Kond Island,
and the places of exile in the Petchersk and
Zyriansk regions.
</p>

<p>
The Kem camp on Popoff Island (about a quarter
of a mile from the shore and six miles from the
town of Kem) is a base depot for the Solovky. In
it are assembled, until navigation opens, thousands
of new prisoners bound for the Solovky from all
parts of Russia. The ordinary criminals who from
time to time are amnestied are sent there from
Solovetsky Island on their way south. Prisoners
are continually being sent from the Kem camp to
the monastery and from the monastery to Popoff
Island for labour purposes — generally the latter,
for most of the work is done on Popoff Island.
</p>

<p>
Before proceeding to a detailed account of the
administration of the Solovky, I may mention that
when I arrived in the domain of the Slon there
were in the concentration camps over five thousand
prisoners of the three categories defined in a
previous chapter — "K.R.'s," "political and party
men," and "<i>shpana</i>," or ordinary criminals.
</p>

<p>
In the monastery itself, the "K.R.'s" and
criminals live in the cells and churches of the
Kremlin which have escaped destruction, the
"politicals and party men" in the hermits' caves
which are scattered all over the island — three, six
or eight miles from the Kremlin. On Popoff
Island the prisoners are housed in hutments erected
by the British — the "K.R.'s" and <i>shpana</i> together,
the "politicals and party men" separately.
</p>

<p>
The supreme head of the administration of the
Northern Camps for Special Purposes is a Moscow
Tchekist, a member of the Vtsik, named Gleb
Boky. (One of the Solovetsky steamers, by the
way, has been re-named <i>Gleb Boky</i> in his honour.)
He is a tall, thin man, apparently well educated.
His bearing is generally gloomy, his eyes piercing;
he always wears military uniform. He is the
typical rigid Communist of superior education,
with an element of cruelty in his disposition. He
lives in Moscow, where he has some other employment
in the Gpu, and only comes to the Solovky
now and then.
</p>

<p>
His deputy, who lives permanently in the
Kremlin of the monastery, is the real head of the
Slon in practice; the fate of the prisoners in the
Solovky is completely in his hands. His name is
Nogteff. He is also a member of the Vtsik, and
was formerly a sailor in the cruiser <i>Aurora</i>. He is
semi-educated, drunken, and rather deaf, with a
conspicuously cruel physiognomy. He is universally
known in the camps by the nickname <i>palatch</i>
(executioner). When he goes round the hutments
and caves of the "political and party" prisoners,
they shout in his face "Go away, executioner!"
(I will explain later how it is that they are able to
do this with impunity.)
</p>

<p>
Nogteff's right-hand man and deputy is an
Estonian Communist named Eichmans. He
suffers from "paradomania." Of smart military
bearing himself, he demands the same of prisoners
in a state of permanent starvation. They are
compelled to salute him. Immediately on his
arrival in the Solovky he began to teach the
prisoners, with blows when required, how to reply
to his "good morning" in a brisk, military tone,
at the same time coming to attention.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived in the Solovky, and until March,
1924, the commandant of the "Kemperraspredpunkt"<a href="#footnote14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
was one Gladkoff, a Tchekist, born at
Kaluga, in Central Russia, and formerly a workman.
He was notable for his open peculation of
Government money and his astounding patronage
of the <i>shpana</i>. Almost illiterate, coarse, addicted
to cards and drink, he was really in no way different
from these common criminals. It was thus on
what might be termed ideological grounds that
Gladkoff established and strengthened the dictatorship
of the <i>shpana</i> over the "K.R.'s" and
politicals, and all the violence we endured at
their hands.

</p>

<p>
In March, 1924, a so-called "change of cabinet"
took place. I will speak of this later, and continue
my portraits of the ministers in the earlier
combination.
</p>

<p>
Boky, Nogteff, Eichmans, Gladkoff — these were
the men who had the power. They were sent to
the Solovky from Moscow by Dshershinsky
himself. The remainder of the <i>personnel</i> of the
Solovetsky and Kem camps were Tchekist
prisoners. There were several dozen of these at
the monastery and on Popoff Island. When the
corruption, fraud, violence or swinish drunkenness
of Gpu officials cannot possibly be concealed from
the public eye, they are brought to account for their
offences without delay. Some are transferred to
other places, some are sent for terms of from two
to ten years to the Slon camps, where they are still
employed in their "special branch."
</p>

<p>
I mention a few of the transported Tchekists
who held, and still hold, important posts in the
administration of the Solovetsky Islands.
</p>

<p>
Nogteff's assistant on the administrative side is
one Vasko, a brutal villain. This individual is the
"public prosecutor" of the Solovetsky Islands,
and all the documents relating to the cases of
the transported persons are in his hands. The
importance of his function is due to the fact that,
although all the "K.R.'s" and politicals are
regarded as having been sentenced by the Gpu
(always in their absence, without any kind of trial)
and the term of their imprisonment is definitely
fixed, in reality they are all in the position of
persons whose cases are <i>sub judice</i>. At any
moment new evidence can be discovered relating
to their cases, with the result that their term of
imprisonment may be extended, or they may be
shot. Comrade Vasko's occupation is to search
carefully for any fresh fact or allegation which may
chain the prisoner to the Solovky more firmly and
for a longer time; and in doing so he does not
shrink from such methods as the employment of
<i>agents provocateurs</i>, the blatant forgery of new
"proofs," and so on.
</p>

<p>
The management of the technical side of the
actual Solovetsky camp is in the hands of Roganoff,
an engineer, sent to the Solovky for offences
relating to the discharge of his functions. I do
not know how he manages the affairs of the camp,
but it is manifest to everyone that Mr. Roganoff,
now that he has turned his coat, is in no way
different from the real Tchekists, either in his
behaviour towards the prisoners or in his self-indulgent
manner of living. His technical
assistants, both at the monastery and on Popoff
Island, are engineers recruited from among the
prisoners. They are people of no importance,
almost as helpless against injustice and ill-treatment
as all the rest of us.
</p>

<p>
The direction of the Northern Camps for Special
Purposes is compelled, for reasons I will speak of
later, to be self-supporting. It, therefore, concludes
agreements of various kinds for the
construction of roads and buildings with prisoner
labour, wood-cutting, etc., with the Karelian
Republic and with various economic organs of the
central Government. It is also endeavouring to
get the ruined factories and workshops on
Solovetsky Island into working order again.
Although all this, as will be shown later, results in
nothing but confusion, the "Natchuslon"<a href="#footnote15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> has at
his disposal something in the nature of a "juridical
adviser in forced labour questions."
</p>

<p>
This, in practice, useless function is discharged
Frenckell, a big Hungarian manufacturer.
Frenckell came to Russia at the invitation of the
Vneshtorg (Foreign Trade Office) to conclude a
commercial treaty and take over certain Soviet
enterprises on a lease by way of concessions.
Instead of this he found himself sent to the
Solovky for two years by order of the Gpu for
"espionage for the benefit of the international
<i>bourgeoisie</i>" (Clause 66 of the Criminal Code).
Frenckell is sometimes ordered to Petrograd and
Moscow on camp business of a commercial and
juridical kind. The term of his punishment expires
at the end of the present year (1925), but — by
reason of the Gpu circular of August, 1924 — he
will leave the Solovky not for Hungary, but for a
further three years' stay, first in the Narym,<a href="#footnote16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> then
in the Turukhansk<a href="#footnote17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> and finally in the Zyriansk
region.
</p>

<p>
The lower administration of the Solovky
consists of "starosty" (headmen), "commanders
of labour regiments," and "commanders of labour
companies."
</p>

<p>
Until recently the headman of the Solovetsky
camp (who was also commander of a labour regiment)
was a Tchekist named Michelson, a lame
misshapen creature of bestial ferocity. When
the Soviet power was carrying out reprisals on the
defeated Crimea, at the end of 1920 and the
beginning of 1921, Michelson was the right hand
of another wild beast, Bela Kun, the former
dictator of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, whom
he supported in his function of "President of the
Triumvirate for the Conduct of the Red Terror in
the Crimea." Michelson, like Bela Kun, became
famous far beyond the frontiers of the Crimea for
his executions of scores of thousands of Wrangel's
officers and men and of the civil population. At
last Dzerzhinsky himself, who could not possibly
be suspected of humane motives, was obliged to
put an end to the Crimean St. Bartholomew's
Nights. Bela Kun was declared to be mentally
abnormal and was recalled to Moscow (this was
referred to in the Soviet papers), and Michelson was
exiled to the Solovky. At the present date he is
directing the activities of the Gpu in one of the
"autonomous" Soviet republics.
</p>

<p>
Another personality worth noting is Marian
Smolensky, a member of the Polish Communist
Party, who when I arrived at the Solovky was
commander of a labour company. In the middle
of 1924 he was released from the Solovky and
received a lucrative post in the Gpu. In the Soviet-Polish
war of 1920 he was not taken prisoner, but
went over to the Reds of his own accord.
Proletarian "solidarity" was coupled in him with
hatred of his fellow-creatures. He was a violent
Polish Chauvinist, and hated the Russians so
bitterly that he grew purple with rage at the very
word "Russia." He was able to indulge his hatred
with impunity at the expense of the prisoners,
whom he beat without mercy. Smolensky's name
has been perpetuated in the annals of the Solovky
by the "Smolensky sticks" which he invented.
These are thick curved cudgels, still used for
flogging prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Another commander of a labour company,
Grakholsky, must not be passed over in silence.
He was shot at the Solovky in the autumn of 1924.
Grakholsky declared that he had been an officer of
the supply service under the Tsar, and gave the
impression of being an intelligent man. He had
only one eye. At the end of 1917, when the
Bolsheviks seized power, he was appointed
commandant of Oranienbaum, on the Gulf of
Finland, and there he had his right eye knocked
out, either by a bullet or by a rifle butt.
</p>

<p>
Grakholsky's chief claim to celebrity was the
part he took in the famous rebellion in the Butyrka
prison in Moscow in the winter of 1923. The
prisoners, who had been kept in prison for years
without any charge being brought against them,
became desperate and started a rebellion under
the direction of the politicals (Social Revolutionaries).
One fine day all Moscow was awakened
by wild yells. The prisoners, three thousand in
number, disarmed the inner guard of the prison,
smashed all the windows, and demanded that their
cases should be dealt with immediately by
Kalinin, the president of the Vtsik, and the
dismissal of the public prosecutor of the Republic,
the notorious Armenian, Katanian. They hung out
of the windows and yelled till all Moscow heard
them, chanting: "We — want — Ka-li-ni-i-i-n!
Ka-li-ni-i-i-n! We don't want Ka-ta-nian!"
</p>

<p>
The whole city flocked to the prison. The
streets leading to it were packed with people, many
of them cheering. Neither persuasion nor threats
could stop the demonstration. The yelling went
on for nearly two hours. At last the Gpu used
force. Two regiments of Gpu special troops
("tchon")<a href="#footnote18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> broke down the resistance offered
and forced their way into the prison. The Gpu
exacted a cruel punishment for the rebellion. Its
organisers were shot in the prison yard the same
day; all the other prisoners were beaten with
ramrods. There was no heating at all in the prison
for a fortnight, although it was freezing hard and
all the windows were broken; the prisoners had
their blankets taken away from them and were put
on "starvation rations." Some of the men, who
had howled louder than the others, were sent to the
Solovky for five years. Grakholsky was one of
these. Vasto, however, declared, six months later,
that he had not only yelled loudly, but had also
been one of the instigators of the demonstration;
and he was accordingly shot.
</p>

<p>
Kvitsinsky, who was sent to Moscow for trial
by Feldman after the Kholmogory inquiry, is
already known to the reader. He was not punished
in any way for his hideous crimes and is now in the
Solovky, perpetuating the glorious traditions of
the "White House" and continually wielding the
"Smolensky sticks."
</p>

<p>
Until the "change of cabinet" in the spring of
1924 the commandant of the Kem camp was, as
I have mentioned, Gladkoff, the patron of the
common criminals. They found an even more
potent defender of their interests in Gladkoff's
wife, a simple peasant woman from Kaluga, who
had her husband completely under her thumb.
Her official title was "administratrix," but the
whole camp called her "Mother," the name given
her by the grateful <i>shpana</i>. And she was in truth
a mother to the criminals. She allowed them to do
no work, released them from the cells, and shielded
them when they robbed and maltreated the other
prisoners. It was absolutely useless to complain to
Gladkoff that the criminals had robbed you of your
last pair of trousers. The commandant of the
"Kem distributing centre" invariably gave the
same answer, plus a few unprintable terms of
abuse:
</p>

<p>
"I don't care if they do rob you. My <i>shpana</i>
have got nothing, and you're <i>bourgeois</i>."
</p>

<p>
Under the regime of Gladkoff and "Mother"
the criminals exercised a dictatorship in the camps;
in fact, to this day they are a privileged caste, the
aristocracy of the Solovetsky Islands.
</p>

<p>
The assistant of the Kem commandant until the
"change of cabinet" was Klimoff, a Tchekist
prisoner. Before he entered the service of
Dzerzhinsky's institution he had been commandant
of the Kremlin in Moscow, and later of
Trotsky's train. On being transferred to the Gpu
he displayed such brilliant capacities for receiving
bribes that he soon began to take the bread out of
the mouth of the president of the provincial Gpu
in which he was employed, and his chief got rid of
him by sending him to the Solovky for ten years.
</p>

<p>
Men of talent come to the front everywhere.
At the Solovky, Klimoff continued to occupy
himself with his speciality, taking bribes. The
Casino-ites<a href="#footnote19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> brought large sums of money with
them to the realms of the Slon and received a
further supply every month from Madame
Kameneff. They simply showered money on
Klimoff, and in return were continually being let
off work of some sort.
</p>

<p>
In 1924, instead of being brought to trial,
Klimoff was transferred to the Solovetsky
Monastery to take over the duties of director of
the "Vokhra"<a href="#footnote20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> (internal security service). A man
named Provotoroff came to Kem in his place, but
soon left again to become commandant of Kond
Island, close to Popoff Island.
</p>

<p>
The assistant of Gladkoff and "Mother" on the
economic side was a Tchekist prisoner named
Mamonoff, a young man of twenty-two or
twenty-three. He had been sent to the Solovky
for ten years for the virtuous actions which all
Tchekists commit — taking bribes, drunkenness
and maltreating arrested persons.
</p>

<p>
Despite his youth, Mamonoff was a man of
experience. By flagrant thefts of State property —
which he used to tell people about when he was
drunk —, fraud and incompetence, he ruined the
Kem camp economically and got the accounts
into hopeless confusion. The Moscow Tchekist
Kirilovsky, who replaced Gladkoff at the end of
March, 1924, refused to take the camp over unless
Mamonoff's proceedings were inquired into by a
special commission. A commission of inquiry was,
therefore, appointed by the central Government,
and spent <i>five months</i> going through Mamonoff's
books and accounts, day after day. An appalling
picture of waste, theft and fraud was revealed.
But Mamonoff received no punishment.

</p>

<p>
Nature herself is against the exiles. The
Northern Camps for Special Purposes lie in the
farthest north. The climate is severe and damp.
Summer lasts only two months, or two months and
a half. It is very late before the snows melt and
spring comes. There are frequent gales, snowstorms,
biting northerly and north-easterly winds.
For three-quarters of the year the Solovetsky
Monastery is completely cut off from the outside
world. The long, dark winter is most oppressive,
especially as the lighting in the huts is so poor.
The damp from the Solovetsky marshes has an
injurious effect on the health of the prisoners, worn
out by hard labour.
</p>

<p>
The Kremlin of the monastery, surrounded by
a high stone wall, reminds one of a fortress. In
it the "K.R.'s" and <i>shpana</i> live in what once
were the monks' cells, which they themselves
have to provide with board-beds and tables, and
to heat, and in the churches. The latter were
plundered not long ago, and many of them have
broken windows. Besides the principal ones (the
Preobrajensky, Troitsky-Zosimo-Sabbatievsky, and
Uspensky cathedrals, and the churches of St.
Nicholas, St. Philip, and the Annunciation of the
Holy Virgin) there are some ten other churches and
chapels and numerous separate hermits' dwellings,
in which the "politicals and party men" live. The
Tchekists occupy the house of the Archimandrite
and the best cells.
</p>

<p>
Popoff Island is about three miles long and two
miles broad. The strait, a quarter of a mile wide,
between it and the mainland is very shallow, so
that it has been found possible to build a bridge
over it, on wooden piles, for the narrow-gauge
railway which connects the island with the town of
Kem — a local branch of the Petrozavodsk-Kem-Murmansk
line. The distance from Popoff Island
station to Kem station — which is two miles from
the town — is about eight miles; there is a halt on
the way, nearer Kem. A wooden track, made of
duck-boards laid down across the marshes, leads
from the concentration camp to the island station,
and similar tracks connect the various buildings.
</p>

<p>
On the eastern shore of Popoff Island are two
wharves, the northern and southern. Only the
latter is in use. It is about forty miles from
Popoff Island to Solovetsky Island — twelve miles
from Popoff Island to Rymbaki, and twenty-eight
more on to Solovetsky Island. Between Popoff
Island and Rymbaki the sea does not freeze in
winter, but between Rymbaki and Solovetsky
Island it does. There are a lighthouse and stores
on Rymbaki.
</p>

<p>
The factory of the "Severoles" (Northern
Timber Company) is close to the southern wharf.
Prisoner labour is employed in it. The Red
soldiers of the 95th Division occupy two large
buildings near the camp, close to the wood store.
</p>

<img src="images/page77_map.png" alt="Popoff Island and its Surroundings" />

<p>
On the northern shore is the wireless station, in
winter the sole means of communication with
Solovetsky Island. The wireless station of the
monastery is in the Kremlin. In clear weather the
notorious Sekirova hill, on Solovetsky Island, can
be plainly seen from the Popoff Island wharf.
</p>

<p>
The concentration camp is a rectangular
enclosure some two hundred yards long and one
hundred and fifty yards wide. It stands on a
marsh at the south-eastern corner of the island, with
heaps of stones scattered about it. The marsh
promotes the spread of malaria, scurvy and lung
complaints. The prisoners are fearfully tormented
by the peculiarly poisonous mosquitoes of the
Solovetsky Islands, which breed in swarms on the
marsh and give one no peace either by day or by
night.
</p>

<p>
The camp is surrounded by a high wire fence;
along this, at intervals, stand huts for the sentries,
each containing eight men. The Red soldiers
in the guardroom outside the camp, generally
thirty-eight in number, form a reserve force, to
assist or replace the guards outside if needed.
The Tchekists on duty are quartered in the commandant's
office inside the camp.
</p>

<p>
All entrance to and exit from the camp is
through the main gate, which is guarded by special
sentries. The second gate (marked 11 on the plan)
is kept permanently shut and is regarded as a
reserve entrance.
</p>

<p>
Most of the huts in the camp were erected by
the British troops which co-operated with the
Russian Northern Army under General Miller.
A few were constructed by prisoner labour under
the Soviet regime. Until 1925 the camp possessed
no latrine, hospital, electric power station, or workshops.
There were no tracks, either of boards or
of earth. Until quite lately the prisoners used to
sink into the sticky slime of the marsh, and the huts
were flooded with liquid mud.
</p>

<p>
The wooden tracks consist of boards and planks,
supported by small piles sunk in the marsh. There
are in all five of these roads or paths. The
principal road runs from the main gate to the
eastern side of the wire fence, and is called the
Nevsky Prospekt. Others run from the reserve
entrance to the Nevsky Prospekt, from the Nevsky
Prospekt to the latrine, from the Nevsky Prospekt
to hut No. 1 (marked 29 on the plan), where the
politicals live, and from the last store hut to the
hospital hut (marked 36 on the plan).
</p>

<img src="images/page80_map.png" alt="The Camp on Popoff Island" />

<p>
Earth tracks run from the Nevsky Prospekt
along the line of store huts (30 to 33 on the plan),
from the Nevsky Prospekt past the kitchen, workshops,
and electric power station to the hospital, and
from the commandant's office past the huts where
the <i>shpana</i> and "K.R.'s" are quartered. Besides
these there are a few narrow, rough tracks through
the marsh — from the politicals' hut to the kitchen,
and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The commandant's office is in hut No. 2 (marked
19 on the plan). This hut is divided off into
several compartments for the use of the various
branches of camp government — administrative,
economic, etc. The "specialist company," which
is quartered in hut No. 4 (marked 20 on the plan),
consists of tailors, bootmakers, joiners, and so on,
who satisfy the requirements of the administration
and the Red soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The electric power station is in charge of an
engineer named Krassin. He was previously in
the Customs service, but was dismissed for peculation
and sent to the Solovky. The workshops are
under an "adherent of Savinkoff," the kitchen is
in charge of an ex-colonel named Rashevsky, and
the stables of another "K.R." named Larin.
</p>

<p>
The business manager of the camp is one Pavloff
(Nikolai Nikolaevitch), a corrupt rascal. He takes
bribes on the auction principle; he who offers most
carries the day. I give one example. There is no
water on Popoff Island; it has to be brought from
Kem, and two carts with cisterns are kept for this
purpose. As fetching water is easier work than
digging up tree-stumps, there is great competition
for this job. Pavloff asked openly who would
give most for it. There were three prisoners who
had managed to bring a good deal of money with
them; they offered more than anyone else —
150 roubles between them — and they were still
fetching water to the camp when I got away.
</p>

<p>
The higher camp authorities live in a small
fishing settlement of about seventy cottages, a short
distance outside the wire fence. The senior official
on duty is quartered in the camp.

<p class="pix40"> <i>
The "Distributing Hut" — Robbed the First Night —
Criminals' Unwritten Code — Punishment of a
Traitor — The Professor's Parcel — Successful
Blackmail.
</i>
</p>

<p>
All newly arrived prisoners are sent first of all to
the "distributing hut" of the camp on Popoff
Island.
</p>

<p>
Hardly have you set foot on the now accursed
soil of the Solovky before you feel the power of
the <i>shpana</i>. When our party, consisting of
"counter-revolutionaries" from the Caucasus,
bishops and monks, a group of Casino-ites and
many others, arrived at hut No. 6 (the "distributing
hut"), we were met by armed Tchekists, themselves
prisoners. They wanted to know first of all
whether there were any Gpu employees or any
criminal agents among us, for if so they might
not go into the hut; the ordinary criminals would
kill them at once. Several men stood aside.
</p>

<p>
The rest of us entered hut No. 6. It was a
huge wooden shed, filled to overflowing with
<i>shpana</i>. There were board-beds in two tiers, one
above the other. The beds and the floor under
the lower tier were covered with half-naked bodies.
The stench was so awful that I nearly fell down.
Drunken yells and drunken weeping, the most
disgusting abuse. There was a feeble glow from a
lamp in a corner.
</p>

<p>
I describe the "distributing hut" in some detail
because all new arrivals have to go through this
torturing stage of their captivity, and, further,
because nothing could be more characteristic of the
whole conditions in the Solovetsky camps.
</p>

<p>
Having been warned by our earlier experience at
Rostoff, we lay down on our things, putting them
under our heads. But this precaution proved to be
inadequate. I was awakened during the night by
a fearful noise. Staring into the semi-darkness,
I perceived with horror that all our things had been
stolen — our provisions plundered, our baskets,
suitcases and boxes broken open. Yells resounded
from one corner, where one of the <i>shpana</i> who had
taken too much for himself was being sentenced to
a beating by an assize of his fellow-criminals. In
another corner three criminals were hitting one of
their comrades over the head with pieces of wood;
he was dripping with blood, but still refused to
give up the linen he held tightly under his arm.
On the upper tier of beds, close to the ceiling, the
national card game, <i>tri listika</i>, was already being
played with our money. At the door a knot of
<i>shpana</i> were conducting trade negotiations with the
sentry, exchanging somebody's rug for spirits.
</p>

<p>
We "K.R.'s" decided next morning that it was
useless to make a complaint. But one of the
politicals in our party, a Social Revolutionary,
indignantly told the commandant about the
behaviour of the <i>shpana</i> who had left him with
only one shirt in winter time. The commandant,
for form's sake, appeared in the hut and called in
timid tones:
</p>

<p>
"Give back the things! What disgraceful
conduct!"
</p>

<p>
The criminals answered with a roar of laughter;
but the next night they would have killed the
"S.R." if we had not defended him.
</p>

<p>
Next morning an old inhabitant of the camp,
Bishop Illarion Trotsky, the right-hand man of the
late Patriarch Tikhon, was ordered to conduct our
party to hut No. 9.
</p>

<p>
An unwritten internal discipline binds the
ordinary criminals together. These starving, half-naked
gallows-birds, dying by scores daily from
scurvy and syphilis, never take a risk. The
peculiar favour and protection which all the
authorities of the Solovky, without exception,
extend to the <i>shpana</i> is very simply explained.
</p>

<p>
The hostility which the ordinary criminal
instinctively feels towards the "K.R.", the educated
<i>barin</i>, is felt in an equal degree by every Tchekist
in the Solovky, though he also sees in each "K.R."
a counter-revolutionary, a Monarchist, a <i>bourgeois</i>.
A further reason why complaints against the <i>shpana</i>
are fruitless is that a large part of the Solovetsky
administration are closely connected with the
criminal classes, not only in their mentality, but in
their pre-Revolution antecedents.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived at Popoff Island, there were
about 1,400 <i>shpana</i> in the camp; the number
of "K.R.'s" could have been divided into this
total several times, and there were only seventy
"politicals and party men." The last-named, for
reasons which I will explain later, do no work
at all, and "Mother" was continually letting
the <i>shpana</i> off labour of all kinds, so that the whole
immense burden of the work to be done was placed
upon the shoulders of the "K.R.'s."
</p>

<p>
This is still the case, although in a lesser degree:
the <i>shpana</i> do little work, the politicals none at all,
and the "K.R.'s" bear the whole burden.
</p>

<p>
The criminals' curious code of ethics combines
all the <i>shpana</i> of the Solovetsky Islands into one
indivisible unit. This code of ethics is ruthlessly
applied. If the criminals discover that there is a
<i>sutchenyi</i> among their number — this word means
in their language a turncoat, a traitor, who is
betraying their secrets to the authorities — he is
immediately put to death in the most cruel manner.
Nowhere is the principle "one for all and all for
one" put into application in so high a degree as
among the common criminals of the Solovky.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of 1924 a gang of footpads, who
had for a long time evaded all attempts to capture
them, were arrested in Moscow. Their leader was
a bandit named Moiseiko; his fellow-robbers nicknamed
him Petlura, for which reason the members
of the band were called "Petlurists." These
footpads had on their conscience, besides a number
of armed robberies, many "wet affairs" (a "wet
affair" means a murder in the thieves' language).
One of the most active of the Petlurists, known
as Avrontchik, turned <i>sutchenyi</i>, betrayed the gang
and brought about its arrest.
</p>

<p>
The gang consisted of thirty-eight persons, both
men and women. Thirty of them were "sent to
the left" (thieves' jargon for "shot") in the
Butyrka prison in Moscow. Eight men, among
them Avrontchik, and four women (the wives of
men who had been shot) were despatched to the
Solovky. When the "traitor" arrived at the
"distributing hut," the surviving Petlurists burst
in and almost beat him to death. The male
Petlurists were arrested and Avrontchik taken to
hospital. But he was not safe even in hospital;
the four women of the band entered the
hospital hut and killed Avrontchik, smashing in
his skull.
</p>

<p>
The affair was referred to Moscow. The Gpu
replied briefly: "shoot." In November, 1924,
the remaining Petlurists, men and women, fell to
Tchekist bullets, confirming by their death the
principles of the <i>shpana</i>.
</p>

<p>
If the <i>shpana</i> do not shrink from murdering
persons objectionable to them, much less does the
robbing of all and sundry seem to them a thing
to be boggled at. Further, they are compelled
to rob by continual hunger, cold — in the Solovky
one quite often sees <i>shpana</i> prisoners <i>absolutely
naked</i> — and their passion for cards and drink.
</p>

<p>
Their robberies, the victims of which are
invariably "K.R.'s," are planned with quite
professional ingenuity. As I have said, on our
arrival at Popoff Island we were moved from
hut No. 6 to hut No. 9. This hut is divided into
four compartments by wooden partitions. In the
first compartment lived the headman of the camp,
in the second the Casino-ites, the third was the
camp prison, and in the fourth were we "K.R.'s,"
having a common wall with the prison.
</p>

<p>
Several times the <i>shpana</i> played the following
trick on us. They committed some offence more
serious than usual, and so, intentionally, got into
the prison; then they bored a hole in the wooden
wall which separated the prison from our quarters,
quite close to the floor, and at night, creeping noiselessly
under the beds, stole our things, food and
money. If anyone tried to recover the things, they
beat him to death.
</p>

<p>
The <i>shpana</i> always shared their plunder with the
prison guards and the headman, so that nobody
paid any attention to our complaints, and once the
headman declared that we ourselves had robbed
each other.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the robberies were followed by
impudent blackmail, also with the close connivance
of the <i>personnel</i>. For example, among
the prisoners in our hut was Professor Krivatch-Niemanetz,
a very old man, over seventy. He was
a Czech by nationality and had been employed in
the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs as a translator.
He was sent to the Solovky (for ten years) by
virtue of that clause of the Criminal Code under
which foreigners are always sent there — Clause 66,
"espionage for the benefit of the international
<i>bourgeoisie</i>." Of course he was absolutely
innocent. Krivatch-Niemanetz was very popular
in the camp and profoundly respected, mainly
because he could speak nearly all the languages in
the world fluently, including Chinese, Japanese
and Turkish, not to mention all the European
languages.
</p>

<p>
The Professor had received a parcel of things
from the "Political Red Cross," which was
presided over by Madame Peshkova, the wife of
Maxim Gorky, and extended its help only to
"politicals and party men." It evidently regarded
"K.R.'s" as simply bandits, delivered as such to
the caprice of Fate, the Solovetsky administration
and the <i>shpana</i>.
</p>

<p>
He was as delighted with the parcel as a child,
but alas! not for long. The <i>shpana</i> had got into
the prison again; once more they broke through
the wall and stole our things, including Krivatch-Niemanetz's
parcel. In the morning the criminals
had recourse to blackmail, a method of theirs
by this time familiar to us all; they sent
to the Professor — by a Tchekist — a letter in
which they offered to give him back his things for
6 tchervontsy (about £6). The Czech, freezing
in the draughty hut, accepted the offer as genuine
despite our warnings, and sent the <i>shpana</i> —
through the same Tchekist — all the money he had,
leaving himself literally without a kopek. As we
expected, he never got either his things or his
money back!
</p>

<p>
Some time after this a number of the <i>shpana</i> left
the Solovky, among them the men who had
robbed the Professor. On their way south they
sent him a letter in which they promised "never
to forget the dear Professor to their last day."
</p>

<p>
The criminals regard stripping the "K.R.'s"
almost as a point of honour, but stripping their own
comrades, their fellow-criminals, as a crime to be
severely punished. There is a special hut on
Popoff Island in which all the parcels for the
"K.R.'s" and politicals on Solovetsky Island
received during the autumn and winter are kept
until navigation opens and it is possible to communicate
with the monastery; when spring comes
they are sent to the monastery by a special steamer.
Several times members of the <i>shpana</i> broke into
this hut, enjoyed the fruits of their pillage with
impunity and received the full approval of their
fellows. But once, when a party plundered the hut
at a time when some parcels for ordinary criminals
were there, they were cruelly man-handled by their
comrades and two of them actually killed.

</h3>

<p class="pix40"> <i>
Hardest Labour Done by "K.R.'s" — Counter-revolutionary:
a Comprehensive Term — A Variegated
Multitude — Special Persecution of the Clergy —
Prominent Clerical Prisoners.
</i>
</p>

<p>
On Solovetsky Island the "politicals and party
men" live in separate cells — hermits' caves — and
on Popoff Island in a special hut. Both at the
monastery and in the Kem camp the "K.R.'s" live
in company with the ordinary criminals. The cells
of the monastery and the huts of the camps are
filled to overflowing with a carefully mixed crowd
of "counter-revolutionaries" and <i>shpana</i>.
</p>

<p>
The "K.R.'s" not only do all the hardest labour,
and have to keep their own quarters clean, but are
obliged to cleanse the criminals' bedsteads of dirt,
remains of food, spittle and lice. Whenever a new
party of "K.R.'s" arrive, they are compelled to
clean out the huts, which the <i>shpana</i> have made so
filthy that the task makes many of the "K.R.'s"
sick. In 1924, it took 1,500 "K.R.'s" two whole
months to clean out the camp on Popoff Island.
It is sufficient to say that the criminals very often
fulfil the requirements of Nature on the spot,
i.e., in the huts.
</p>

<p>
The <i>shpana</i>, of course, are not in the least
grateful for having all this done for them. On the
contrary, this work of the "K.R.'s", so utterly
degrading to human self-respect, is accepted by the
criminals as a matter of course, and only exposes
those who do it to fresh outrage from the <i>shpana</i>,
supported by the camp <i>personnel</i>.
</p>

<p>
For example, when we had cleansed the hut
indicated by the authorities of all the filth that was
in it, the grateful <i>shpana</i> sent us an ultimatum,
with a detailed schedule of the quantities of bread,
sugar, tobacco, tea, etc., which were to be handed
over immediately to the criminal who brought the
ultimatum. If we failed to comply with the
ultimatum, we were told, we should be first beaten
and then plundered in more thorough fashion.
</p>

<p>
We had to hand over the things demanded.
Ultimatums of this kind are very fashionable
among the <i>shpana</i>; the "K.R.'s" are snowed under
with them, both at the monastery and in the Kem
camp.
</p>

<p>
It is very hard to give an exact account or
analysis of the prisoners labelled "K.R.'s." Their
number is considerable — there are nearly three
thousand on Solovetsky Island — and they are composed
of such variegated elements that a general
definition of a "K.R." is very hard to arrive at.
A division of them into groups, even an approximate
one, will enlighten the reader in a general
sense as to who the "K.R.'s" are, and why they are
in the Solovky, but it is bound to be incomplete;
there are in the camps many "K.R.'s" whom one
does not know where to place.
</p>

<p>
There are in the Northern Camps for Special
Purposes many representatives of the so-called
liberal professions — engineers, barristers, literary
men, artists, teachers, doctors. There are many
teachers from the primary and secondary schools
and from the universities, both men and women;
the latter are in a majority. There are a considerable
number of non-party peasants and workmen,
artisans and small employees. The Cossacks of the
Don, the Kuban and Siberia, and the peoples of the
Caucasus, are strongly represented. Of the non-Russians
who are Soviet subjects the most
numerous are Estonians, Poles, Karelians (some of
those who returned from Finland on the strength
of an "amnesty")<a href="#footnote21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> and Jews. The last-named
are sent to the Solovky, in most cases with their
families, either for adhering to Zionism, or for
"economic counter-revolution," or for so-called
"armed banditism" — by which the Gpu understands
anything it pleases, from membership (even
in the past) of a Monarchist party to the manufacture
of counterfeit notes.
</p>

<p>
There are many foreigners in the Solovky; I will
allude to them in greater detail later.
</p>

<p>
The largest categories of all consist of officers
of the old and the new armies, business men,
pre-Revolution and of the "Nepman"<a href="#footnote22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> order,
important representatives of the old regime, the
bureaucracy and the aristocracy, and also the clergy.
</p>

<p>
At the present time there are some three hundred
bishops, priests and monks in the Solovky; to this
number should be added several hundred laymen
who were sent to the Solovky along with them,
generally under Clause 72 of the Criminal Code —
"ecclesiastical counter-revolution, resistance to the
confiscation of church valuables, propaganda, the
education of children in a religious sense," and so
on. The clergy at the Solovky, though more
oppressed and humiliated by the camp authorities
than any other category of prisoners, are remarkable
for the submissiveness and stoicism with which
they endure their moral and physical sufferings.
</p>

<p>
Being accustomed to hard bodily labour from
childhood, the clergy are rightly considered to be
the best workers in the camps, and from this point
of view are almost valued by the administration,
though it exploits them infamously. Priests are
sent to do all the most exhausting tasks. For
example, whole sections of the narrow-gauge
railway were laid entirely by clerics.
</p>

<p>
All kinds of religious services, of course, are
forbidden. One of the priests in the camp on
Popoff Island, a feeble old man, died. He begged
the commandant with tears in his eyes to allow the
Vladika Illarion to administer the Holy
Sacrament to him. The commandant refused in
abusive terms.
</p>

<p>
Every day in the year is counted as a working
day, and at Easter and Christmas the authorities
endeavour to give the clergy the most degrading
work possible — for example, cleaning out the
latrines.
</p>

<p>
Among the most prominent clerics confined in
the Northern Camps for Special Purposes are the
following:
</p>

<p>
The Vladika Illarion (Trotsky), head of the
diocese of Moscow and the right-hand man of
the late Patriarch Tikhon. Neither when at liberty
nor in prison has the Metropolitan Illarion ever
entered into conflict with the Soviet power; but he
has always been a vehement champion of pure
Orthodoxy as a counterpoise to the "living
Church," which is liberally subsidised by the Gpu.
For the defence of his faith, and for his intimate
connection with the Patriarch Tikhon, the bishop
was sent to Archangel for three years and served
his term of punishment under the most horrifying
conditions. He returned to Moscow and again
vigorously opposed the "living Church," took a
skilful part in religious discussions, mercilessly
shattered the Communistic babble of his opponent
Lunatcharsky,<a href="#footnote23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> and was transported once more —
this time to the Solovky.
</p>

<p>
The Vladika Masuil (Lemeshevsky) directed
the affairs of the diocese of Petrograd after the
shooting of the Metropolitan Venianin. Sentenced
to transportation under Clause 72 of the Criminal
Code — "ecclesiastical counter-revolution" — by
which the Bolsheviks understand, <i>inter alia</i>, the
defence of Orthodoxy against the destructive
attacks of the "living Church," the bishop arrived
at the Solovky in September, 1924. Six other
bishops and monks and twelve laymen were sent
there at the same time and for the same cause.
</p>

<p>
Bishop Seraphim (Kolpinsky), Bishop Peter
(Sokoloff), Acting Bishop of Saratoff, and Bishop
Pitirim (Kryloff), the Igumen of the Kazan
Monastery, as well as about fifteen members of the
black and white clergy from that monastery, were
all sent to the Solovky under this same Clause 72.
Hundreds of other bishops, priests and monks
were transported, not only because the religion they
professed was "opium for the people,"<a href="#footnote24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> but
because they would not approve the plundering of
the churches for purposes which had nothing to do
with the relief of the famine victims, and which
they denounced to the public as the work of the
supporters of the "living Church," bought by the
Government.

<p>
The grounds for which people have been transported
to the Solovky are so various, and very
often so completely baseless, that one cannot help
supposing them to be pure inventions of the
Tchekist "jurisprudence."
</p>

<p>
For example, among the prisoners there is the
aged Countess Frederiks. During the war, as a
Red Cross nurse, the old lady performed admirable
service in tending wounded officers and men. And
now, in the camp, she receives no parcels from the
Red Cross, gives what help she can to the sick,
and lives in a state of permanent semi-starvation,
ceaselessly subjected to jeers and insults. She
was transported for no other reason than that she
had the misfortune to be the sister of Count
Frederiks, who was Minister of the Imperial
Court under the murdered Tsar, and was well-known
as an intimate counsellor of Nicholas II.
And while she was sent to the Solovky, the Count
himself, a very old man of nearly a hundred, was
until lately living in freedom in Petrograd; only
quite recently was he given permission to leave for
Finland.
</p>

<p>
In one of the cells on Solovetsky Island (the
so-called Women's Building) the wife of a
prominent minister of the old regime is perishing
of under-nourishment and unaccustomed hard
bodily labour. The official note of the decision
in her case ran: "Transported to the Solovky for
five years, as being the wife of a minister of
Bloody Nicholas!" The minister himself fills a
conspicuous post at Moscow under the Soviet
Government!
</p>

<p>
A locksmith named Timoshenko was sent from
Voronesh to the Solovky for two years. He was
a simple workman and had had nothing whatever
to do with politics. He continually endeavoured
to obtain from Vasko an answer to his question —
for what offence he had been sent to a concentration
camp. Not till 1925, when his term of two
years expired, was he accused of belonging to the
"Savinkoff counter-revolutionary organisation"
and sent to cool his heels for three years more in
the Narym region.
</p>

<p>
At the same time other "Savinkoffists" were
sent to the Solovky from Novokhopersk, a district
town in the Government of Voronesh. They
were: Vrashnikoff, former agent of Count
Vorontsoff-Dashkoff's property in the Caucasus;
Savinoff, a technician; Krivjakin, the business
manager of a Soviet institution, and others. To
these were added an engineer named Novitsky,
from the Government of Poltava, and a crowd of
peasants from the Government of Voronesh.
Many of the peasants, when told at the
Solovky that they were charged with complicity
in "Savinkoff's conspiracy," asked doubtfully:
</p>

<p>
"Savinkoff?<a href="#footnote25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Who's he? A general?"
</p>

<p>
When I was in the Solovky, one Epstein
arrived there; he had been sentenced to three
years. When he asked why he had been transported,
he received from the examining judge the
answer:
</p>

<p>
"Because you're a business man!"
</p>

<p>
Exactly the same answer was received by another
criminal, a Jew tailor named Gurieff, who kept a
ready-made clothes shop. (He is now in charge
of the tailors' workshop in the Kem camp.)
</p>

<p>
Not long ago two Poles, named Minitch and
Vintovsky, fled to Russia from Poland. The
frontier authorities gave a ceremonial reception to
the men, who had "escaped from cruel imprisonment
by the Polish Pans," but the Moscow Gpu
sent them to the Solovky for three years. The
two Poles are now cursing the day when they
decided to cross the frontier of the "freest Government
in the world!"
</p>

<p>
Every year there arrive at Kem some two
thousand "K.R.'s," who are sent on to Solovetsky
Island when navigation is possible. The arrivals
are especially numerous during the months which
immediately precede November 7th (October 25th,
old style), the date of the Bolshevist Revolution
of 1917.
</p>

<p>
Every year at this time the Vtsik — thus controverting

<i>bourgeoisie</i> and the shameless <i>émigrés</i>" about the
cruelty of the Soviet power — publishes a wide
amnesty to "all enemies of the ruling proletariat."
The presidents of the provincial and district
branches of the Gpu, by way of carrying out the
directions of the humane Vtsik, shoot half their
prisoners a few days before the amnesty and send
the rest to the concentration camps, to which the
terms of the amnesty decree state that it is not
extended.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in reality, nobody is amnestied on
November 7th. The Vtsik is satisfied, the Gpu
is satisfied too; "the lies of the shameless
<i>bourgeoisie</i>" have been exposed.
</p>

<p>
I could fill several pages with the names of
people who have been "amnestied" in this manner.
I will quote, as an example, a case in which not only
the individual who was stupid enough to believe
in the good faith of the Tchekists, but his relations
too, were "amnestied." At the end of 1923 a
soldier of Denikin's army, a peasant from the
Government of Poltava, returned to Russia on the
strength of the amnesty proclaimed by the Soviet
Government in November of that year. He was
given a Soviet passport on the frontier, and on
arriving at his home went to the provincial Gpu,
was registered, was sent away again and spent
several days with his family.
</p>

<p>
Result — at the beginning of 1924 the soldier
was sent to the Narym region of Siberia for three
years, while his father and father's sister were
despatched by the Gpu to the Solovky for
<i>concealing a counter-revolutionary</i> (Clause 68 of
the Criminal Code)! At the time of my escape
these peasants, the victims of this singular
"amnesty," were still in the Solovky, waiting to
be sent on to the Zyriansk region.
</p>

<p>
"Amnestied" <i>émigrés</i> are continually being
sent to the Solovky. Just before my escape a
large party of <i>émigrés</i> arrived, nine-tenths of them
private soldiers; there were a few officers, among
them a cavalry subaltern named Menuel and
Saprunenko, who had been aide-de-camp to the
Ukrainian hetman Skoropadsky.
</p>

<p>
The Soviet power extends a real amnesty only
to people, whether <i>émigrés</i> or living in Soviet
Russia, whose names can be used later as a decoy.
Such gentlemen, for example, as ex-General
Slastschoff and similar renegades can live in
freedom and even occupy responsible posts so long
as this suits the book of the Gpu, so long
as the Gpu reckons that it can make use of the
name of one of these "signal-changers"<a href="#footnote26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> to prove
"the good faith of the Soviet power, which
amnesties all repentant <i>émigrés</i>." But as soon as
the renegade in question has "done his job," he
can go away, or, to be more correct, he is sent away,
to exile or to the next world. It is sufficient to
recall the fate of the well-known Social Revolutionary
Savinkoff, who was "amnestied" by
the Bolsheviks — after which the Tchekists
flung him from a fifth-floor window of his
prison.
</p>

<p>
Ordinary <i>émigrés</i> who return are immediately
sent to the Solovky or the Narym region — that
is to say, if the "supreme measure of punishment"
(shooting) has not already been applied to them.
The latter fate, as a rule, awaits officers.
</p>

<p>
The Soviet Government, returning evil for
good, sends to the concentration camps people who
have "besmirched themselves" by working with
organisations of which the unhappy Russian
people will always retain a grateful memory.
Among the prisoners at the Solovky is a dentist
named Malivanoff, a Moscow Jew. Malivanoff
gave active help to the A.R.A. (the American
relief organisation for the benefit of the famine
victims), with the result that he was sent to the
Solovky for five years. As the Criminal Code of
the U.S.S.R. does not at present provide any
punishment for giving relief to famine victims,
the clause relating to "economic espionage" was
applied to Malivanoff! A number of other
Russians who worked with the A.R.A. and famine
relief organisations from other countries were sent
by the grateful Gpu to Siberia, to the Narym and
Petchersk regions.
</p>

<p>
Karpoff, well known as the stage manager of the
Alexandrinsk Theatre in Petrograd, and subsequently
of the Great and Little Theatres in
Moscow, was sent to the Solovky in company
with other artists — Jurovsky, Georges, etc. — on
the charge of "counter-revolution." During my
stay there he was sent on to another place of
exile.
</p>

<p>
If the Tchekists want to transport somebody,
but cannot find a handle for doing so, Clauses 68
("concealing a counter-revolutionary") and 72
("ecclesiastical counter-revolution") serve their
purpose most conveniently.
</p>

<p>
One of the most peculiar cases is that of a
man named Witte, from Petrograd, who was
transported because he bore "a counter-revolutionary
name!"
</p>

<p>
There are Communist engineers — <i>e.g.</i>, one
Osipoff, who was famous throughout the camp for
the incredible quantity of lice on his body — naval
officers who had been "seksoty,"<a href="#footnote27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> jewellers, hair-dressers,
landowners, followers of Makhno (the
Ukrainian guerilla leader), "economic bandits,"
commanders of the Gpu troops, watchmakers — in
short, prisoners of every conceivable profession,
position, rank and designation.
</p>

<p>
The case of the brothers Myshelovin, watchmakers,
was a curious one. They were both
accused of forging and uttering notes, although the
evidence given before the examining judge and
the results of a domiciliary visit showed that
while one of the two brothers had actually uttered
counterfeit notes, the other was completely
innocent. And what was the decision of the Gpu?
It sent the guilty brother to the Solovky for three
years — and the innocent one for ten years!! The
motives of Tchekist "courts" in pronouncing
such sentences as this must always be a mystery to
us all.
</p>

<p>
A very interesting figure was the technical
engineer Krasilnikoff (Nicholas Dimitrievitch).
He had been sent to the Solovky for "ecclesiastical
counter-revolution," but in reality he had had no
connection with anything of the kind. Before the
Revolution he had been well known in Petrograd
as an able and vehement opponent of Socialism of
all shades. When the Bolsheviks came into power,
Volodarsky sent for him several times and tried to
persuade him to stop preaching counter-revolution.
But the truculent engineer, taking advantage of
his immense authority among the workers,
continued to make speeches and publish his
pamphlets. He soon migrated to Moscow and
there continued his activities, the tendency of
which was, as in pre-Revolution days, to discredit
Socialism of all kinds.
</p>

<p>
Dzerzhinsky himself was interested in
Krasilnikoff and sent for him. The engineer
appeared at the Gpu headquarters, and there, in
the study of the President of the Extraordinary
Commission, Dzerzhinsky and Krasilnikoff disputed
for hours on end about Socialism and its
Utopian aims. It must have been almost the only
time in his life that Dzerzhinsky permitted
freedom of speech — and that in the very offices of
the Gpu! Krasilnikoff — a brilliant speaker —
endeavoured to persuade the head Tchekist to
abandon all hope of being able to make a reality
of such nonsense as Socialism. Dzerzhinsky
would not agree, but put forward arguments on
the other side.
</p>

<p>
The night wore on. Dzerzhinsky offered the
engineer a camp bed in his study, and in the
morning ordered that he should be given coffee
and allowed to go. Soon after, however, he was
arrested by subordinate Tchekists and sent to the
Solovky.
</p>

<p>
In the camp, Krasilnikoff was literally eaten up
by lice. I myself, having passed through dozens
of prisons on my way north, possessed the
experience of a lifetime in the matter of vermin;
but never and nowhere have I seen such multitudes
of lice as on the engineer. Every morning and
every evening he used to kill vermin in incredible
quantities, remarking every time he caught
one:
</p>

<p>
"Aha, got him — that's another!"
</p>

<p>
The Solovky swallow up old and young alike.
In February, 1925, fifty students and schoolboys
from Theodosia, Sevastopol, Simferopol and
Yalta, in the Crimea, arrived at Popoff Island.
They had all got three years for organising a
"counter-revolutionary conspiracy in complicity
with the foreign <i>bourgeoisie</i>." The latter was
alleged to be directing the conspiracy from
Constantinople, but the whole thing was quite
unproved. Besides adult students, the party
included some twenty pupils of the middle and
upper classes in the secondary schools, quite boys
still.
</p>

<p>
Not long before I came to the Solovky, the Gpu
of the Trans-Caucasian Soviet Republic had sent
thither forty Tchetchentsy,<a href="#footnote28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> very old men. One
of them looked out of the window of a hut, which
is forbidden by some Tchekists, on which the
whole party were sent to the Sekirova hill —
notorious at the Solovky as the place of torture —,
put into "stone sacks" (an operation described in
a later chapter) and flogged with "Smolensky
sticks" till they fainted. One of these aged men
was 110 years old.
</p>

<p>
These old Tchetchentsy had been transported
as hostages for their sons, grandsons and great-grandsons
who had joined guerilla bands and were
waging a ceaseless war with the Bolsheviks — a war
which is still going on. They themselves had not
committed any kind of offence.
</p>

<p>
The practice of taking hostages, and of carrying
out violent reprisals on the relations and even the
acquaintances of rebels and <i>émigrés</i>, has been
developed by the Soviet power into an elaborate
system of terror, which shrinks from nothing that
may help it to attain the object in view — the
submission of the entire Russian people to the will
of the leaders of the Communist Party.

</p>

<p>
The "politicals and party men" on Solovetsky
Island at the present time number about five
hundred, including a hundred and fifty women
and several dozen children. Children are placed
on the same footing as adult prisoners as regards
rights and obligations, and so receive rations. On
Popoff Island there are now sixty male politicals
and twenty women. Most of them are members
of the Social Revolutionary, Social Democratic,
"Bund" and Anarchist parties, and intermediary
shades, transported to the Solovky for active
opposition to the Soviet power in the years
1917-19 and passive criticism of its actions in the
years that followed.
</p>

<p>
Solovetsky Island is roughly forty miles in
circumference and is rich in caves, inhabited in
bygone days by religious monks, hermits and holy
men vowed to silence. These caves, cut in the
rock, recall mediæval country houses. They are
scattered about the island, the distance from the
monastery varying from three to six or even ten
miles. Here the politicals are settled in parties,
twenty or thirty persons in each cave.
</p>

<p>
In the Kem camp they live in a special hut,
No. 11 (marked 29 on the plan), which is divided
into two rooms, one for the men and one for the
women and children. The hut is surrounded by a
wire fence and is guarded by special sentries.
</p>

<p>
On Solovetsky Island the "politicals and party
men" can walk about the island and visit each
other quite freely, without guards. On Popoff
Island they are taken out for exercise with a
sentry, not accompanied by "K.R.'s" or ordinary
criminals.
</p>

<p>
Standing much closer, in their ideology, to the
Bolsheviks (if the Bolsheviks can be said to have
any ideology) than the "K.R.'s" do, the politicals
naturally receive a certain consideration from the
Soviet authorities and have some attention paid to
their needs and demands. In this respect the
Soviet power is influenced partly by the right wing
of the Communist Party and to a considerable
extent by the Socialists of Western Europe, to
whose utterances the Communists, despite their
assertions to the contrary, listen attentively. The
result is that while it sends "politicals and party
men" to places of exile, it keeps them there under
conditions which are paradise compared to the quite
insupportable existence of the "K.R.'s" in the
Solovky and in the other concentration camps.
</p>

<p>
It was not till after the "change of cabinet" in
the spring of 1924 that the "K.R.'s" were
permitted to correspond with their relations — the
letters being carefully read by the Tchekists — and
to receive parcels from them. The politicals have
always enjoyed these rights.
</p>

<p>
If a "K.R." has no relations, or his relations
are not in a position to send him money, food and
other necessaries, he is doomed to death from
starvation, for the camp ration, issued for ten days
in advance, is sufficient for two days only. In this
connection, it should not be forgotten that the
Gpu, when it sends a "K.R." to a place of exile,
generally confiscates all the property belonging to
him and his family. The politicals receive everything
they need in abundance, not only from their
relations, but also from (1) the "Political Red
Cross" presided over by Madame Peshkova,<a href="#footnote29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
(2) from foreign Socialist organisations, which
send help on a most generous scale, and (3) from
the "committee for the assistance of Russian
prisoners and exiles." It must be emphatically
stated that the "K.R.'s" did not once receive any
help from this body.
</p>

<p>
The politicals have their own library, which is
continually supplemented with new Russian and
foreign books. They are allowed to subscribe to
Soviet newspapers and foreign journals of a non-political
character. They are allowed to form
societies for cultural purposes. The leaders of the
politicals read papers on various questions and
organise debates, both in the caves and in hut
No. 11. The politicals are allowed to occupy
themselves with sport. The administration listens
attentively to any complaints they may make.
</p>

<p>
The "K.R.'s" have no advantages of the kind.
The camp reading-room is at their disposal, but as
the <i>shpana</i> periodically turn it into a latrine, no
"K.R." ever puts his nose inside it. Two publications
are received in the camps, the newspaper
<i>Bednota</i> (Poverty) and the periodical <i>Bezbozhnik</i>
(The Godless One), but even this literature the
"K.R.'s" do not get hold of until two or three
months after its arrival, for it is read first by the
Kem administration, then by the Solovetsky
administration, and then by the Red soldiers. Of
course, the "K.R.'s" are not allowed to carry on
any work of a cultural, let alone a political nature,
and in any case they would have no time, ceaselessly
occupied as they are with work beyond their
strength. How the administration treats complaints
from "K.R.'s" the reader knows already.
Finally, the politicals, according to established
tradition, do no work at all, which is at the same
time an immense privilege and an atrocious
injustice. All the work, both "outside" (outside
the camps) and "inside" (inside the camps), falls
on the shoulders, first and foremost, of the
"K.R.'s" and in a lesser degree of the <i>shpana</i> — the
latter only in quite recent times.
</p>

<p>
But is it solely due to the sympathy of foreign
Socialists, and a certain degree of conciliatoriness
on the part of the Soviet Government, that the
"politicals and party men" have been able to
secure themselves a more or less bearable existence
in the Solovky? Certainly not. It is in a large
degree the achievement of the politicals themselves.
</p>

<p>
I am a convinced opponent of the politicals'
social programme, the ultimate aspirations of
which are indistinguishable from those of the
Bolshevist programme and are absolutely Utopian.
But none the less, I will pay due tribute to the
persistency and fearlessness they have shown in
upholding, if need be at personal sacrifice, the
claims put forward by them as a corporate body in
order to alleviate the detestable conditions of their
life as exiles.
</p>

<p>
The discipline among the Socialists in the
Solovky excels even that of the <i>shpana</i>. They will
face a hunger strike, a rebellion, even death itself
almost without hesitation, to attain the object they
have set before them.
</p>

<p>
In the winter of 1923 the politicals at the
Solovetsky Monastery, then over a thousand
strong, made a skating rink near one of the caves.
The camp administration observed parties of
skaters on the rink singing revolutionary songs.
They were ordered to stop singing, but did not
obey. Then Nogteff brought a platoon of Red
soldiers down to the rink and opened fire on the
skaters without warning. Nine of them (six men
and three women) were killed and many wounded.
</p>

<p>
The politicals declared a hunger strike and
demanded that a commission of inquiry should be
sent from Moscow. The whole body of them
took part in the strike, on Popoff Island as well as
on Solovetsky Island. Some of them could not
stand upright from exhaustion, and were taken to
hospital. One of these was the well-known
"S.R." Bogdanoff, who until he was transferred to
the Narym region in April, 1925, was generally
recognised as the leader of the "politicals and
party men" in the Solovky.
</p>

<p>
Nogteff went to the hospital to persuade them
to stop the hunger strike. He was received with
cries of "Executioner!" Bogdanoff, anxious
that Nogteff should not worry the other sick men
by his presence in the room, told the attendants to
carry him out into the yard on a stretcher. Then
he asked Nogteff:
</p>

<p>
"What can I do for you?"
</p>

<p>
Nogteff began again to try to persuade him to
stop the hunger strike.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all you have to say?" Bogdanoff
replied. "Take me back into hospital. I don't
want to talk to a murderer."
</p>

<p>
The end of it was that the politicals had their
way. In September of the same year a commission,
consisting of Smirnoff (public prosecutor of
the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R.), Katanian
(public prosecutor of the Gpu), and Soltz, was
appointed. But the Socialists did not get from
the commission what they expected. Nogteff was
not punished in any way for shooting the nine
persons. The commission found that he had
acted in <i>self-defence</i>!
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1924 the politicals again
declared a hunger strike. This time they
demanded that the food should be improved.
The hunger strike lasted thirteen days. Several
persons died, and about a hundred were taken to
hospital. Moscow was appealed to, and this time
granted the politicals' demand. From that time
onward they began to receive daily 2 lbs. of bread
(white and black), 1 lb. of meat, good butter, milk,
eggs, etc., and these rations are still being issued to
them at the time of writing.
</p>

<p>
At the end of 1924 and the beginning of 1925
students expelled from the universities began to
arrive in the Solovky from Petrograd, Moscow
and other towns. The Soviet Government had
begun to expel and arrest students of <i>bourgeois</i>
origin in order to make room for Communists.<a href="#footnote30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
They came in three parties. The first two
parties, consisting of about a hundred persons,
including thirty women students, arrived at Kem
in August, 1924. They included representatives
of all parties (Monarchists, "S.R.'s," "S.D.'s,"
Anarchists, etc.). They declared that they were
prisoners of the "political and party" category
and demanded that they should be quartered in
caves, with the privileges of the other cave
dwellers, and receive the increased ration. The
administration refused their request. The students
declared a hunger strike with the friendly support
of all the politicals. After several persons had
died of starvation the students were recognised as
political prisoners and sent to live in caves on Kond
Island.
</p>

<p>
Kond Island lies about ten miles from the
monastery. Formerly "seksoty" (secret Gpu
agents) of both sexes used to be sent there; it is
their business to promote espionage and paid delation
among the prisoners. Nogteff bribes useful
people by giving them better rations, gets everything
he wants out of them, and when they are
no longer required, quarters them in remote caves.
</p>

<p>
The third party of students (twenty-six in
number, including two Anarchists) arrived at Kem
in April, 1925. On the journey from Petrograd
to Kem they smashed up the trucks in which they
were travelling. Their demand to be treated as
politicals was refused by the administration. The
students, again supported by the politicals, declared
a hunger strike, which lasted five weeks. Nogteff
appealed to the Gpu, which ordered him to send
the students back to Petrograd. I do not know
what happened to them afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The "politicals and party men" carry on
all negotiations with the authorities through
"General" Eichmans, as they object to having
any communication with Nogteff. They dare
even to boycott publicly the most exalted representatives
of the Gpu and the "Narkomyust"
(People's Commissariat for Justice).
</p>

<p>
At the end of 1924 a so-called "unloading
commission," consisting of Smirnoff, Katanian,
Gleb Boky and a secretary, came to the Solovky.
The prisoners hoped much from it, but their hopes
were not realised. The commission certainly
unloaded the Solovky, but only as regards <i>shpana</i>;
nearly four hundred ordinary criminals were
released, but not a single "K.R." or political.
</p>

<p>
When bidding farewell to the departing <i>shpana</i>,
Katanian announced to the assembled prisoners:
</p>

<p>
"If the prisoners who are being released now
reform and become useful citizens of the Soviet
Republic, I shall come back next year and liberate
another batch."
</p>

<p>
Thus the fate of the "K.R.'s" and politicals
was made dependent on the conduct of ordinary
criminals when set at liberty!
</p>

<p>
The commission stayed in the Solovky three
days, and spent most of their time out shooting.
The Tchekists exterminated the last survivors of
the wild and tame animals, the latter introduced by
the monks at some earlier period. On the last
day Katanian visited the caves on Solovetsky
Island, but the politicals drove him away with
cries of "Go away, murderer! To hell with the
executioner!"
</p>

<p>
The public prosecutor of the Supreme Court,
Smirnoff, called a meeting and made a long speech.
His speech was entirely devoted to controverting
"the impudent calumnies of the <i>émigré</i> White
Guard Press and foreign <i>bourgeois</i> newspapers."
He attacked in particular the <i>émigré</i> Socialist paper
<i>Dni</i><a href="#footnote31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> for "misleading the proletariat of Europe by
its criminal falsehoods about the Solovky."
</p>

<p>
On his return to Moscow he wrote and published
a pamphlet entitled "The Solovky" (State
Printing Office, Moscow, 1925), in which he stated
that "complete liberty" prevailed there, that the
food was "excellent," and that the treatment of the
prisoners by the administration was "more than
lenient."
</p>

<p>
To crown the whole performance, Smirnoff did
not shrink from open mockery of the prisoners.
A large number of copies of the pamphlet were
sent to the Solovetsky camps and distributed to
us — to us, who were tasting every minute of every
day the "liberty," the "excellent food" and
"more than lenient" treatment by the administration
of which Smirnoff talked!
</p>

<p>
If Nogteff, Eichmans and their fellows listen to
what the politicals have to say, the attitude of the
lower <i>personnel</i> can be taken for granted. The
conversations of the politicals with the commanders
of the labour regiments and companies, quartermasters,
and overseers of the kitchens and workshops
have the tone of orders. Their headman
Bogdanoff, when speaking to any subordinate in
the commandant's office, always began his sentences
with the words "we wish" instead of "we ask."
Before rations were distributed, Bogdanoff used to
go to the quartermaster and choose the best meat,
white bread, and so on, for his section of the
prisoners. His successor as headman, the Social
Democrat Mamuloff, a lawyer from Vladikavkaz,
enjoys the same rights.
</p>

<p>
The politicals, having plenty of time to themselves,
are able to educate their children, and bring
them up according to their own political views.
One sees a ten-year-old boy, the son of a political,
walking through the huts, greeting the Tchekists
and sentries with abuse, and, when the prisoners
ask him in fun to which party he belongs, replying
proudly:
</p>

<p>
"I'm a Socialist. Down with the Communist
usurpers!"

associate with the women of the <i>shpana</i>. The
company of these women is horrible.
</p>

<p>
There are at present about six hundred women
in the Solovetsky camps. At the monastery they
are quartered in the "Women's Building" in the
Kremlin; on Popoff Island they occupy the whole
of hut No. 1 and portions of other huts. Three-quarters
of them are the wives, mistresses, relatives
or simply the accomplices of the common criminals.
</p>

<p>
Women are officially transported to the Solovky
(and to the Narym region) for "persistent
prostitution." At regular intervals, in all the
large towns of European and Asiatic Russia, raids
against prostitutes are carried out in order that they
may be sent to the concentration camps. The
prostitutes, who under the Soviet regime have
combined to form regular professional unions,
from time to time organise street processions in
Moscow and Petrograd by way of protest against
the raids and the transportations; but this is of
little avail.
</p>

<p>
The character and ways of the female <i>shpana</i> are
so savage that a description of them, to anyone
unacquainted with life in the Solovetsky prison,
may sound like the delusions of a madman.
</p>

<p>
For example, when they go to the bath-house,
they undress a long time before in their huts and
walk about stark naked, to the accompaniment of
roars of laughter and approving remarks from the
camp <i>personnel</i>.
</p>

<p>
The female criminals are just as addicted to
gambling card games as the men. If they lose,
they hardly ever have any money, decent clothes
or food with which to pay. In consequence, the
most barbarous scenes may be witnessed every day
in the camps. The women play cards on the
condition that the loser must immediately go to
one of the men's huts and give herself to ten men
one after the other. This must take place in the
presence of regular witnesses. The camp administration
has never intervened to put a stop to this
loathsomeness.
</p>

<p>
The influence the female criminals have on
educated women, "K.R." prisoners, can be
imagined. The foulest cursing, in which the
names of God, Christ, the Virgin and all the
saints are called upon, universal drunkenness,
indescribable debauchery, thieving, filth, syphilis —
all this must in the long run be too much for the
most stubborn nature.
</p>

<p>
To send an honest woman to the Solovky is to
turn her in a few months into something worse
than a prostitute — a piece of dumb, dirty flesh, an
object of barter, at the disposal first and foremost
of the camp <i>personnel</i> itself.
</p>

<p>
Every Tchekist in the Solovky has from three to
five concubines at the same time. Toropoff, who
was appointed assistant to the Kem commandant
on the administrative side in 1924, established a
regular harem in the camp, continually replenished
according to his choice and at his orders. The
Red soldiers who guard the camp violate women
unpunished.
</p>

<p>
According to the camp rules, twenty-five
women — "K.R.'s" and <i>shpana</i> — are selected every
day to act as servants to the Red divisions guarding
the Solovky. The soldiers are so lazy that the
prisoners even make their beds.
</p>

<p>
The headman of the Kem camp, Tchistakoff,
not only has his dinner cooked and his boots cleaned
by women, but they even have to <i>wash</i> him!
</p>

<p>
The youngest and prettiest women are usually
chosen, and the Tchekists are free to treat them as
they please.
</p>

<p>
All the women in the Solovky are <i>officially</i>
divided into three categories: (1) a rouble
woman (<i>rublevaya</i>), (2) a half-rouble woman
(<i>poltinitchnaya</i>), and (3) a fifteen kopek woman
(<i>piatialtynnaya</i>).
</p>

<p>
If one of the camp authorities requires a "first-class"
woman, i.e., a young "K.R." who has not
been long in the camp, he says to the sentry:
"Bring me a rouble woman."
</p>

<p>
Honest women who refuse the "improved
ration" which the Tchekists give their concubines
very soon die of under-nourishment or tuberculosis.
Such cases are particularly frequent on
Solovetsky Island, where the bread usually does
not last through the winter — i.e., till navigation
begins and fresh supplies can be brought — and the
already miserable rations are cut down by a half.
</p>

<p>
The Tchekists and the <i>shpana</i> infect the women
with syphilis and other venereal diseases. How
widespread these diseases are in the Solovky may
be judged from this fact. Until recently the
syphilitics, both male and female, were quartered
on Popoff Island, in a special hut (No. 8). But
their number increased to such an extent in the few
months before I escaped that hut No. 8 would not
hold them all, and the administration could think
of no better solution of the problem than to put
the patients in other huts, occupied by uninfected
persons. Of course, this only led to a still more
rapid increase in the number of cases.
</p>

<p>
If their solicitations meet with resistance, the
Tchekists do not shrink from heaping insult on
their victims. I will mention two out of a number
of such cases known to me.
</p>

<p>
At the end of 1924 a very pretty Polish girl
of seventeen was brought to the Solovky. She
had been sentenced to be shot, along with her
father and mother, for "espionage in the interests
of Poland." The parents were shot, but as the
girl was under age, the supreme penalty was in her
case commuted to transportation to the Solovky
for ten years.
</p>

<p>
The girl had the misfortune to attract Toropoff,
but had the pluck to refuse his disgusting proposals.
Thereupon Toropoff ordered her to be
brought to the commandant's office, accused her of
concealing "counter-revolutionary" documents on
her person, stripped her naked and searched her
under the eyes of the whole camp guard —
examining with care those parts of her body where
it seemed to him that the "documents" might best
be concealed.
</p>

<p>
One day in February, 1925, a Tchekist named
Popoff appeared in the women's hut very drunk,
accompanied by a number of other Tchekists, also
drunk. He went up to Madame X's bed. This
lady belonged to the highest social circles and had
been sent to the Solovky for ten years after her
husband had been shot. Popoff dragged her out
of bed and said:
</p>

<p>
"Won't you come outside the wire with us?"
(It was there that women were violated.)
</p>

<p>
Madame X was in a state of raving hysteria till
the next morning.
</p>

<p>
Uneducated and half-educated "K.R." women
are exploited by the Tchekists without scruple.
Particularly lamentable is the fate of the many
Cossack women, whose husbands, fathers and
brothers have been shot and they themselves
transported.

Espionage for Mexico! — A Cryptic Message — Gpu
Tactics — Attempts to Escape Savagely Punished.
</i>
</p>

<p>
Most of the foreigners in the Solovky were sent
there on the charge of "espionage for the benefit
of the international <i>bourgeoisie</i>" (Clause 66).
Sometimes a second clause is brought into action
as well as Clause 66, quite groundlessly; the
Tchekist "jurisprudence" is most skilful in
discovering a crime where there is not the shadow
of one.
</p>

<p>
Among the prisoners in the Solovky are Count
Villa, Mexican Consul-General in Egypt, and his
wife. It must have been, one would think, rather
difficult for a man living in Cairo to direct
"Mexican espionage" in Soviet Russia, especially
in view of the fact that the Consul-General does
not speak or understand a single word of Russian.
The circumstances of his arrest were as follows.
</p>

<p>
Count Villa's wife is a Georgian lady, <i>née</i>
Princess Karalova. In 1924 she and her husband
came to the Caucasus to visit her mother, with the
permission of the Soviet Government and with their
passports in order. Unluckily, just at that time
the Georgian rebellion broke out. The Bolsheviks
shot the Countess's brother, Prince Karaloff, and
sent the diplomatist and his wife to the Solovky
for three years for "espionage for the benefit
of Mexico." They arrived there in February,
1925.
</p>

<p>
The Consul-General is living in the Solovky by
virtue of a diplomatic passport guaranteeing him
<i>personal immunity!</i> On his arrival in the camp
he tried to send to Mexico a full account of the outrage
committed on him by the Soviet authorities,
but the Solovetsky censorship destroyed it. Then
the Count had recourse to the language of Æsop
and sent his Government a telegram which began
with the words:
</p>

<p>
"I am making a very interesting tour in the
north of Russia."
</p>

<p>
Evidently the fact of the Mexican diplomatist's
transportation to the Solovky is known abroad, for
not long before I escaped some things were sent to
him from London by aeroplane (he had been
robbed by the Tchekists when he was arrested).
He carries on an active correspondence with
Tchitcherin in French, demanding his release. But
Mexico is a long way off; she has no merchant
fleet or money to lend the Soviets; and so the
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, in its polite
replies to its colleague's letters, passes over in
silence the question of his liberation. The only
result of Tchitcherin's letters was that the Consul-General
was exempted from work in the camp.
But Countess Villa, like all women "K.R.'s,"
scrubs hut floors and washes Tchekists' shirts.
</p>

<p>
Representatives of every nation, great as well as
small, may be met with in the Solovky —
Englishmen, Italians, Japanese, Frenchmen and
Germans, besides natives of lesser States. The
reasons for their transportation are as a rule shamelessly
inadequate. Is seems as if the Gpu were
deliberately frightening foreigners away, so that
they shall not visit Russia, become acquainted with
the country or open commercial or any other kind
of relations with it. I referred in an earlier
chapter to the case of the Hungarian manufacturer
Frenckell, whom the Vneshtorg (Foreign Trade
Office) invited to Russia and then sent to the
Solovky. There have been many cases of the
kind. For example, an Estonian named Motise
went to Moscow to see the All-Russian Exhibition,
and was sent straight from the Exhibition to the
Solovky!
</p>

<p>
At a time when there was a Government crisis
in Lithuania, and the struggle between the political
parties had reached an abnormal degree of bitterness,
a member of the defeated party fled from the
country into Soviet Russia. He was an engineer
officer in the Lithuanian army. He was completely
strange to Soviet Russia and to the
Communists, and believed that he would find in
the neighbouring country asylum as a political
refugee. But directly he crossed the frontier he
was arrested, accused, despite his protests, of
"organising a counter-revolutionary plot and
espionage in the interests of Lithuania," and sent
to the Solovky!
</p>

<p>
In the monastery and on Popoff Island there are
a large number of persons formerly attached to
the diplomatic missions of foreign States. They
are mostly Poles, Estonians, Finlanders, Latvians
and Lithuanians, employees of the Legations,
Consulates and missions of their respective
countries, who have been arrested on the charge of
"espionage" and, more rarely, "speculation."
</p>

<p>
All the foreigners live in the constant hope
that their Governments will exchange them for
Communists. The administration treats them
cruelly. They get the same rations as the
"K.R.'s," and the work they are given is for the
most part severe.
</p>

<p>
There have lately been several attempts to
escape. The would-be fugitives have mostly
been Estonians, Latvians, Finlanders and Poles.
Nogteff has, therefore, given orders that prisoners
of those nationalities shall not be taken to work
outside the camps.
</p>

<p>
Attempts to escape — always unsuccessful — are
punished first by cruel torture and then by shooting
(although, according to the regulations, the
maximum punishment is the prolongation of the
prisoner's term of imprisonment by one year).
</p>

<p>
In March, 1925, a Finlander attempted to
escape from the Solovetsky Monastery. He had
gone to the latrine, accompanied by a sentry,
climbed over the wall and found himself on the
seashore. In these latitudes spring generally
comes late, and the ice by the Kremlin was still
thick enough to bear. The Finlander fled as fast
as he could towards the woods, a little way along
the coast. He was observed; the alarm was
given and shots were fired after him. Just as
he had reached the woods, where he could have
hidden until he could continue his flight with
better prospects of escaping recapture, he came
unexpectedly to a break in the ice, and halted in
indecision. The Tchekists caught him.
</p>

<p>
The Finlander was brought back to the camp.
He was beaten for <i>nearly an hour</i> with such
violence that the thick "Smolensky sticks" were
broken. Then, all dripping with blood, he was
shot.

</h3>

<p class="pix40"> <i>
Kem Camp's New Rulers — A Military Parade — A
Much-Married Tchekist — Old Abuses Continued.
</i>
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1924 the <i>personnel</i> of the
concentration camp on Popoff Island was changed.
The members of the Uslon (Direction of the
Northern Camps for Special Purposes) and, at the
monastery itself, all the Tchekists remained at
their posts. This was what the prisoners called
the "change of cabinet."
</p>

<p>
A Moscow Tchekist, Ivan Ivanovitch Kirilovsky,
formerly a sergeant in one of the Guards regiments,
was appointed commandant of the Kem camp in
place of Gladkoff. As stated in an earlier
chapter, he refused to take over until a commission
was appointed by the central Government to
examine the camp accounts. When the commission
discovered that gross extravagance and fraud
had taken place, Gladkoff was sentenced to
transportation for five years for "peculation and a
negligent attitude towards his exalted (?) duties."
Mamonoff, who was directly responsible for the
frauds, was not punished at all; and, for that
matter, Gladkoff himself was pardoned two days
after his sentence and given a new appointment in
the Gpu at Kaluga.
</p>

<p>
Before Kirilovsky's arrival it was said in the
camps that he was a decent fellow. We were soon
to have ocular demonstration of his "decency."
Kirilovsky is still in command of the camp, with
the same assistants.
</p>

<p>
His arrival was the occasion for an elaborate
ceremony. Eichmans, already familiar to the
reader, whose dream was to turn the camps
into military colonies of the Araktcheeff<a href="#footnote32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> epoch,
paraded the starving prisoners, including women
and children, several days in succession, and made
them execute movements, obey words of command,
and so on, in military style. When Kirilovsky
approached the camp, we were drawn up in two
ranks.
</p>

<p>
"Attention! . . . Right dress!"
</p>

<p>
The headman went up to Kirilovsky with his
report.
</p>

<p>
"All correct in the labour regiment under my
command."
</p>

<p>
The commanders of all the labour companies did
the same. Then Kirilovsky greeted us:
</p>

<p>
"Good day!"
</p>

<p>
"Good —— day!"
</p>

<p>
This cruel farce went on for nearly an hour.
At last Kirilovsky asked whether anyone had any
request to make, or any complaint against the
administration. His question, of course, remained
unanswered. If anyone had had the audacity to
make a complaint, he would have been taken to the
"Sekirka" (the place of punishment) that very
day and been flogged to death with "Smolensky
sticks."
</p>

<p>
Kirilovsky's assistant on the administrative side
was, as I have mentioned, Toropoff, a typical
vagabond, with goggling sheep's eyes. He was
formerly a platoon commander in the 95th
Division of Gpu troops, which does guard duties
on Popoff Island. Apart from his devastating
stupidity, his principal characteristic is that he gets
married everywhere he goes. On Popoff Island
he was not content with a harem of women
prisoners, and got married — for the sixth time —
to a "cod-eater." ("Cod-eaters" is the name
given by the prisoners to the inhabitants of the
fishing settlements round the camps, whose main
article of food is cod.)
</p>

<p>
Kirilovsky's assistant on the economic side
was one Nikolai Nikolaevitch Popoff. He was
always extremely well dressed, was not a Tchekist
and not even a Communist. He was a most
enigmatic personality. Sometimes he said he had
been an officer in the Guards, sometimes an official
with special duties in one of the Tsarist Ministries,
sometimes Trotsky's adjutant. He was, in any
case, a man of very good education and outward
polish. He had an impediment in his speech, and
was malignant and cruel in his dealings with
"K.R.'s." When the prisoners passed him on
their way to work, Popoff used to say to his suite
of Tchekists — in a loud voice, so that the "K.R.'s"
might hear:
</p>

<p>
"There's a pack of criminals — do you hear? —
criminals! They're our enemies. We'll put the
wind up the whole crowd of them!"
</p>

<p>
The "change of cabinet" made little difference
to the situation of the prisoners. The only
modification was that "putting the wind up"
them, and the thieving of State funds and their
modest rations by the administration, became more
constant than before. Gladkoff stole openly,
Kirilovsky under a camouflage of "honesty."
</p>

<p>
The Solovetsky life and regime in general —
the heavy toll of labour, the reprisals, the self-indulgent
manner of living of the <i>personnel</i> —
remained as they had been.

</p>

<p>
The huts in Popoff Island camp are about forty
yards long and ten yards in breadth. The
politicals' hut is twice as large as the others. From
two hundred to three hundred persons are as a
rule quartered in each hut; in Nos. 5 and 6,
occupied mainly by <i>shpana</i>, there are over seven
hundred persons.
</p>

<p>
One cannot breathe as night approaches; the
stench is awful. In the evening, when the prisoners
return from work, the huts, full of cracks, holes in
the roofs, and draughts from all quarters, are so
cold that the inmates shiver like men with fever.
It is impossible to sleep at night for the stuffiness
and human exhalations. We used to strip naked
and pile all our clothes on top of us.
</p>

<p>
The board-beds are arranged along the walls in
two tiers. Everyone tries to get an "upper
berth," for if you lie below a continual shower of
lice, remains of food and spittle descends on you.
Sanguinary fights take place for beds in the upper
tier.
</p>

<p>
The electric power station was not constructed
till the end of 1924. Until then an apology for a
lamp — a tin containing a wick slightly damped with
paraffin — flickered in the middle of each hut.
This gave light to the three or four beds nearest to
it; all the rest of the hut was in darkness. Now
every hut is lighted with a small electric light
globe (16 watts), but this is quite inadequate for
such large huts. There is always a crowd under
the one tiny lamp, trying to read, or write to
their relations. The absence of light is particularly
trying in winter. The headmen of the huts
profit by the situation to take bribes, either in
money or in kind, for "a place in the lamp-light"!
</p>

<p>
"Nep" — the New Economic Policy — affected
even the Solovky. They were placed on a "self-supporting"
basis, and the sum granted annually
by the central Government for the upkeep of the
camps was considerably reduced. Thus in the
present year (1925) the Solovky received only
250,000 gold roubles as against two millions
demanded by Boky and Nogteff.
</p>

<p>
There is no need to feed the prisoners, even on
a semi-starvation diet. But it is quite indispensable
that the administration should pocket
large sums of money. Therefore the Natchuslon
and his minions have crushed the last drops of
energy out of the prisoners and turned them all
into dumb slaves.
</p>

<p>
Work in the Solovky is divided into two
categories — "outside" (outside the wire fence)
and "inside" (inside the camp). For outside
work the prisoners are generally taken from
Solovetsky and Popoff Islands to the mainland.
Among the tasks which come under the head of
outside work are: fetching wood, draining the
marshes, laying, clearing and keeping in order
railway lines and roads (earth and wooden), cutting
timber for the necessities of the camp and for
export, and loading and unloading timber, stones
and supplies. The names of the vessels used for
transporting cargo are the steamers <i>Gleb Boky</i> and
<i>Neva</i> and the barge <i>Klara</i>, so named in honour of
the German woman Communist Clara Zetkin.
</p>

<p>
By inside work is meant clearing away snow,
helping in the kitchen and workshops, removing
refuse from the latrines and the huts occupied by
ordinary criminals, and performing services for
the Tchekists. The women scrub the floors of the
huts and offices, cook food, do the Tchekists' and
Red soldiers' washing, sewing, etc.
</p>

<p>
Work begins at 6 a.m. both summer and winter.
According to the regulations work stops at 7 p.m.,
but in the Solovky there is a twelve hours' working
day, with an interval for dinner at 1 p.m. Actually
work goes on much longer than this, at the
discretion of the supervising Tchekist. This is
particularly the case in summer, when the prisoners
literally have to work to fainting point; in that
season work often goes on from 6 a.m. to 12 or 1
the following night.
</p>

<p>
There is <i>no Sunday in the Solovky</i>, nor is there
any other day of rest in the week. Every day is a
working day. On the great festivals, Easter,
Christmas, etc., the hours of work are usually
lengthened in order to insult the feelings of the
religious prisoners.<a href="#footnote33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> Only <i>one</i> day in the year is
set apart as a festival . . . the First of May.
</p>

<p>
Illness, physical weakness, old age and extreme
youth are not taken into account in the slightest
degree. A refusal to work on the ground of
illness, even when the illness is obvious to the
Tchekists themselves, involves, for a first offence,
removal to the "Sekirka" (the place of punishment),
and, for a second offence, shooting,
although, according to law, the punishment for
refusal to work — and even then only without
adequate cause — is the extension of the term of
imprisonment by one year.
</p>

<p>
The most exhausting labour is fetching wood in
winter. This work is absolutely insupportable.
You stand up to your knees in snow, so that it is
difficult to move. Huge tree-trunks, cut away
with axes, fall on the prisoners, sometimes killing
them on the spot. Clad in rags, with no mittens,
with only bast shoes on your feet, hardly able to
stand for weakness caused by under-nourishment,
your hands and whole body are frozen stiff in the
bitter cold.
</p>

<p>
The minimum daily task is as follows: four
men have to cut, split and pile four cubic sajenes
(a sajene is about two yards), and till they have
done this they are not allowed to return to the
camp. An extra hardship attached to all outside
work is that if the prisoners do not get through
their minimum task up to time and return to camp
punctually, the <i>shpana</i> take the kitchen by storm,
and they get no dinner.
</p>

<p>
Once I was sent to the shore near Kem to cut
wood with a party of other "K.R.'s." The wood
was urgently needed, and we were chased out of
our huts at 5 a.m. As a rule sentries are changed
at 12 p.m. But this time, for some reason or
other, no relief for our escort was sent to the wood
where we were at work. The Red soldiers, not
remarkable for discipline, took us back to the
camp, demanding to be relieved. Toropoff cursed
them and called up a fresh escort of Tchekists.
Then we were driven straight back to our work in
the same wood without any interval for dinner,
and did not return till 4 a.m. In other words, we
worked for nineteen hours in severe cold without
food, and without interruption save for our two
extra marches to and from the camp!
</p>

<p>
Everything in the Solovky that could be
plundered was plundered long ago, and everything
that could be sold was sold. To obtain new
resources, the authorities made various big labour
contracts in the territory of the "autonomous"
Karelian Republic — for example, for the construction
of a road from Kem to Ukhta. But seeing
that unemployment menaces Karelia itself, the
Karelian Vtsik continually complained to Moscow
that the Slon was taking the bread out of the
mouths of the Karelians. The agreements were
cancelled, but the Solovetsky administration
profited by them nevertheless. This is what
happened. Nogteff submitted to Moscow more
or less fantastic schemes for labour undertakings
on Karelian territory, and asked the Gpu for a
money subsidy and spirits, the latter for the workmen,
toiling chin-deep in the marshes! The
money and spirits, when they arrived, were divided
among the Tchekists, those most intimate with
Nogteff receiving the larger share.
</p>

<p>
As constructional and commercial schemes did
not yield a large enough profit, the Solovetsky
authorities saw the only way out in a reduction of
the rations. This they proceeded to carry out.
</p>

<p>
Every prisoner, however hard the labour he was
engaged on, was henceforward given 1 lb. of black
bread daily. The bread is issued for ten days
ahead, so that at the end of this time it is as hard
as a stone. The bread is badly baked; the flour
is stale and has a bitter taste.
</p>

<p>
Hot food is issued twice a day. Dinner is a
plate of soup, made of mouldy codfish — evil-smelling
water, without groats or butter; supper a
tureen of millet or buckwheat gruel, again without
butter. The "K.R.'s" often get no supper,
because the <i>shpana</i> prisoners, who have lost their
own portion at cards, go and rob the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
In the camp accounts every prisoner is entered
as receiving 3 zolotniks of sugar a day, or (as this
also is issued for ten days in advance) 30 zolotniks
per issue. (A zolotnik is <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>96</sub> of a Russian lb.)
What each prisoner actually gets every ten days is a
half-glass of half-frozen liquefied sugar containing
10 or 12 zolotniks. The Tchekists mix the sugar
with water and thus steal 18 to 20 zolotniks on
each ration, which, in a camp containing several
thousand prisoners, means a profit of two or three
score poods every day of issue.
</p>

<p>
It is also stated in the accounts that the prisoners
receive one-eighth of a lb. of butter and one-eighth
of a lb. of tobacco. In reality no butter or
tobacco at all are issued in the camps. Casks of
butter and hundreds of poods of tobacco are sold
at Kem by the authorities, who pocket the money.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, according to the regulations, every
prisoner engaged in hard bodily labour is supposed
to receive, besides his food ration, 35 kopeks a day
pocket money. The money for this purpose is
sent by the central Government and is additional
to the ordinary budget. No prisoner has ever
received these 35 kopeks. Every penny of this
"bonus" goes into the pockets of the Tchekists.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that before the "change of
cabinet" the feeding in the Solovky was better
than it is now. Then the prisoners got preserves,
large quantities of which — enough for two years —
were left behind by the British. The present
ration amounts to nothing else than the murder
of the prisoners by a slow death from starvation.
I calculate, on the basis of the requirements of a
man engaged in hard bodily labour, that this
ration, issued for ten days, is barely sufficient for
two or three days!
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned earlier in my narrative, the
politicals receive the "improved ration," which is
almost sufficient.
</p>

<p>
The Red soldiers get the "northern ration,"
with plenty of butter, fats, white bread, and even
spirits.

Hospitals Without Drugs — "Prisoners Must Not be
Ill" — A Madwoman in Command — Mortality
among Prisoners Encouraged — A Kindly Tchekist.
</i>
</p>

<p>
The "Medpomoshtsh"<a href="#footnote34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> (medical help) in the
Solovetsky Islands is in fact medical helplessness.
Owing partly to lack of resources, partly to the
ill-will of the administration of the camps and the
secret instructions of the Moscow Gpu, there is in
the Solovky only one really effective cure for
illness — death.
</p>

<p>
The sanitary conditions in the camps are
horrible. Not only are huts, kitchens, latrines,
etc., in an incredible state of filth, but the
Solovetsky "hospitals" themselves can truthfully
be called breeding-places for epidemics. The
damp, marshy locality, the bad water, and the
millions of mosquitoes and lice all render powerful
assistance in creating and spreading disease.
</p>

<p>
The prisoners have no change of linen, no soap,
no proper clothes or boots. Their organisms,
debilitated by permanent under-nourishment and
hard work, are not in a state to resist disease.
</p>

<p>
There is a "hospital" in the Kremlin of the
Solovetsky Monastery. The word should be
placed within quotation marks, because this
hospital has no drugs of any kind, the beds are
indescribably dirty, the patients are given the
ordinary starvation ration, and the place is very
often unheated.
</p>

<p>
The doctor in charge of it, himself a prisoner,
has repeatedly attempted to persuade the
Natchuslon that in the absence of drugs, bed linen
(the patients lie on bare boards), soap, eatable food,
and a latrine in the hospital itself (the patients have
to go out in the yard in all temperatures, even in
winter), the "treatment" of the prisoners is
nothing else than deliberate murder. But the
Solovetsky administration has always refused his
demands. Fresh thousands arrive in the Solovky
every year, and the huts must be cleared of
"superfluous elements." Once Nogteff actually
said:
</p>

<p>
"Prisoners have no business to be ill!"
</p>

<p>
The "hospital" on Popoff Island may serve as
another fairly good specimen of Solovetsky
"medical help." A woman is in charge of it, by
name Lvova (Maria Nikolaevna). She is a highly-trained
doctor. Before she was sent into exile she
was in the Red Cross, and served on literally every
front in the Great War and the civil war.
Subsequently she was a "seksotka" (secret woman
agent for the Gpu) but was ascertained to have
"talked indiscreetly about secret Gpu affairs," and
was sent to the Solovky for five years.
</p>

<p>
This woman, perhaps not bad in the depths of
her heart, has been shattered by her work for
the Gpu and the life in the Solovky. She has
lost all self-control. No one in the Solovky,
even the most disreputable common criminals,
curses with such complete mastery of the art,
applies such foul terms of abuse to men and God
Himself, as the directress of the hospital.
Criminals often go to the hospital just to listen to
Lvova's swearing and introduce her latest gems of
obscenity into their own talk.
</p>

<p>
No one in the Solovky drinks so much, or drinks
him- or herself into such a swinish condition, as
Maria Nikolaevna. She has reached the lowest
pitch of moral disintegration. And her care of the
sick is what might be expected of a person in
such a state. Human life, for her, has ceased to
have the slightest value. The hospitals of the
Solovetsky Islands are in themselves almost a
guarantee that the patients who enter them will die
<i>en masse</i>. Lvova accelerates the patient's death
by her roughness, her complete indifference to
their sufferings, the cruelty of a person on the
verge of insanity. When patients complain of the
horrible state of things in her hospital, she always
replies:
</p>

<p>
"The worse the better; all the more of you'll
kick the bucket" — followed by a quite unprintable
oath.
</p>

<p>
But I will not raise my hand to throw a stone at
this woman; from living in insane conditions she
herself has become insane. But have Nogteff and
the other "administrators" of the Solovetsky
Islands neither eyes nor ears? Why have they
put a madwoman at the head of the medical service
on Popoff Island?
</p>

<p>
I gave the answer to this question at the
beginning of the chapter. The central authorities
of the Gpu, and under them the Solovetsky
Tchekists, are deliberately increasing the mortality
in the Solovky. A further proof of this is in the
fact that prisoners are not allowed to send for a
doctor from Kem <i>even at their own expense</i>. The
Kem doctor attends only the Solovetsky Tchekists.
</p>

<p>
The "K.R.'s" and politicals fear the Solovetsky
hospitals like the plague. If prisoners of these
categories fall ill, and cannot cure themselves by
"home remedies," they die in the huts, begging
not to be taken to hospital. Only the <i>shpana</i>, who,
like Lvova, set no value either on their own lives
or other people's, go to hospital of their own
accord. In consequence, the ordinary criminals die
in dozens daily, mainly of scurvy.
</p>

<p>
The water of the Solovetsky Islands has in it
some quality which ruins the teeth, and the consequent
toothache is intensified by cold and the
draughts in the huts. A dentist is urgently needed
in the camps. It is true that there is a dentist in
the Kremlin of the Solovetsky Monastery —
Malivanoff, known to the reader as an A.R.A.
worker, punished by the Bolsheviks in return for
his services — but he has no drugs or instruments.
</p>

<p>
On Popoff Island this question is decided in a
radical manner. There is a man named Brusilovsky
in the camp. Before the Revolution he was a
<i>feldsher</i>, or local surgeon; after the Revolution —
a Tchekist belonging to the Gpu of Elisavetgrad,
in what is now the Government of Odessa,
formerly the Government of Kherson. He was
sent to the Solovky under Clause 76 of the
Criminal Code — "armed banditism." Despite
his profession of Tchekist, Brusilovsky is a very
nice, sympathetic fellow. He decided to do what
he could for the victims of toothache, and somehow
got hold of an ordinary blacksmith's pincers, with
which he pulls out teeth.
</p>

<p>
Of course, nothing can be done to cure the teeth
while they are decaying, for there is nothing to do
it with, neither drugs nor instruments; all that can
be done is to pull them out, to which the sufferers
always readily consent. Brusilovsky never takes
any money for his services. He has a huge
practice, especially among the <i>shpana</i>, whose teeth
he pulls out rows at a time. The first time he
pulled out quite sound teeth too, for practice.
</p>

<p>
This compassionate Tchekist treats syphilis too.
His method of dealing with this complaint is also
the last word in Solovetsky science. A compound
of infusions of herbs, spirit and something else is
injected with an ordinary syringe. He evidently
still needs practice in this branch, for syphilis is on
the increase in the camps, and the mortality from
it is growing steadily.

<p class="pix40"> <i>
Chief Punishments — A Freezing Dungeon — "To the
Mosquitoes!" — A Mediæval Torture — Mass
Shootings No Longer Necessary.
</i>
</p>

<p>
The leaders of the Communist Party declare that
the Northern Camps for Special Purposes are
something in the nature of a reformatory. The
punishments administered in these establishments,
they would have the world believe, are intended
to make the prisoners mend their ways and become
useful citizens of the Soviet Republic.
</p>

<p>
In reality, the camp punishments, like the camp
medical arrangements, are based upon no other
calculation than that of sending the largest possible
number of prisoners, more or less swiftly, to "the
other side."
</p>

<p>
Refusal to work, insubordination towards the
authorities, "counter-revolutionary propaganda,"
insulting words or behaviour to the <i>personnel</i>, the
discovery of a "criminal past" (this is Vasko's
occupation), attempted escape — for these offences
there are a number of punishments, in accordance
with the heinousness of the offence. I will mention
the chief punishments:
</p>

<p>
(1) The "Sekirka."
<br/>
(2) "To the Mosquitoes!"
<br/>
(3) Prolongation of the term of imprisonment.
<br/>
(4) "Stone sacks."
<br/>
(5) Shooting.
</p>

<p>
Such corrective measures as blows in the face,
the confiscation of parcels from relations for an
indefinite time (for the benefit of the confiscator!),
flogging with the whip or only "Smolensky
sticks" without "stone sacks," etc., are so common
in the Solovky that there is no need to dwell on
them.
</p>

<p>
The "Sekirka" is a prison on the notorious
Sekirova hill, on Solovetsky Island, two miles from
the Kremlin. In bygone days it was the cave of one
of the most honoured of the legendary heroes of
the Solovetsky Islands. The "guilty" prisoner is
sent to the Sekirka for a term of from two to six
months. The regime there is as follows. The
prisoner receives daily half a pound of bread, a jug
of cold water, and nothing else. All the doors and
windows of the cave are fastened. He has no
communication at all with the outside world. The
dungeon is absolutely unheated. As a rule, when
the term of his punishment comes to an end, there
is nothing left of the prisoner but a frozen corpse.
In rare cases a half-dead skeleton emerges from the
Sekirka.
</p>

<p>
"To the Mosquitoes!" is a form of punishment
very popular with the Solovetsky Tchekists.
The manner of its infliction is as follows. The
prisoner is stripped naked and made to stand on
a particular stone opposite the commandant's
office. He is ordered, with threats of "stone
sacks" and shooting, to stand absolutely still, not
to move a finger and not to drive away the
mosquitoes, which cover the poor wretch's body as
with a thick black crust. The torture is continued
for several hours. When the punishment is over,
the victim's body is one huge sore from the bites
of the poisonous insects. The weaker prisoners
die, and the stronger cannot sit or lie down for
many weeks after the punishment.
</p>

<p>
Prolongation of the term of imprisonment is a
punishment now comparatively seldom applied,
for the simple reason that the orders recently
circulated by the Gpu have made every prisoner
<i>a convict for an indefinite term</i>. When he has
served his two, three, five or ten years, he is sent
on from the Solovky to the Petchersk region,
then to the Narym, then to the Zyriansk, and so
on, unendingly. For more serious "offences,"
therefore, the Tchekists send the prisoners to the
"sacks."
</p>

<p>
In the old times, every monk in the Kremlin,
and every holy man in the caves, had a small
cellar cut in the rock near his cell, in which he
kept his food supplies. These cellars, three or
four feet in depth, have no doors, and the food
was placed in them from above through small
openings.
</p>

<p>
These are the famous "stone sacks." The
Tchekists take the prisoner to the "sack," and ask
him:
</p>

<p>
"How'll you get in — head first or feet first?"
</p>

<p>
If the prisoner gets into the "sack" head first,
he is beaten with "Smolensky sticks" on the
back and legs; if he gets in feet first, he is beaten
about the head and face. The beating goes on till
his whole body is inside the "sack." The "sack"
is too narrow for him to sit, and too low for him
to stand up straight, so that he is obliged to stand
with his knees bent and his head poked forward.
He is imprisoned in the "sack" for a period
varying between three days and a week. The
rations are the same as at the Sekirka. Few people
can endure this mediæval punishment.
</p>

<p>
There are no mass shootings at the Solovky like
those carried out at the "White House," but
individual shootings are very frequent, and are
regarded as an ordinary occurrence. A larger or
smaller number of prisoners are shot whenever the
Soviet Government retaliates for measures of
suppression against Communists in foreign States
by a terrorist outburst on its own part. Thus,
over a hundred persons, both Russians and
foreigners, were shot after the suppression of the
Communist revolt of December 1st, 1924, by the
Estonian Government, and a rather smaller
number after the suppression of the rebellion in
Bulgaria.
</p>

<p>
I gathered from the candid statements of the
Tchekists that the Gpu has now no need to make
a regular practice of mass shootings, because more
humane measures — slow murder from starvation,
work beyond the prisoners' strength, and "medical
help" — are perfectly adequate substitutes.
</p>

<p>
It would be a mistake to suppose that one must
commit some kind of offence to be sent to the
Sekirka, the "sacks" and the mosquitoes, or to
be shot. The prisoners are handed over by the
central authorities to the unchecked caprice of the
camp administration. If the Tchekists dislike
your face, if you are seen crossing yourself on the
sly, if you have said anything about your hard lot
in your letters to your relations — the Sekirka and
the "sacks" open their dreadful doors to you.

Luxurious Proletarians — Merry Gatherings at Kem —
A Revolting Orgy — "Holding the Banner of
Communism Aloft" — How Criminals are
Released.
</i>
</p>

<p>
The concentration camp on Solovetsky Island is
guarded by the 3rd Escort Regiment of the Gpu
troops (300 rifles strong), and that on Popoff
Island by the 95th Division of the Gpu troops
(150 strong). In spite of the good food they
receive, scurvy rages among the Red soldiers, as
does also syphilis. The soldiers, with the exception
of those on duty guarding the camps, live in
private quarters.
</p>

<p>
The Solovky guards, drawn from the criminal
<i>canaille</i> which, after the October Revolution,
suddenly discovered its "class consciousness" and
joined the Communist Party in tens of thousands,
spend all their time in card-playing, debauchery,
swilling home-distilled spirits and drunken orgies.
</p>

<p>
In this they follow the example of the higher
officials. The life led by the Solovky authorities
is far from proletarian. Nogteff, Eichmans,
Vasko, Kirilovsky, Popoff and the rest deny
themselves nothing. Having earned piles of
money at the expense of the prisoners, the
"administrators" lead a thoroughly non-Communistic
life. Liquor, clothes, and other things
are always arriving for them in truck-loads from
Moscow, Petrograd and Kem. I myself took
part in the unloading of two of these trucks.
They contained different kinds of vodka, Russian
and foreign wines, including champagne, liqueurs,
all kinds of <i>hors d'œuvres</i>, expensive clothes, both
men's and women's — the latter for the harems —
comfortable furniture, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The "administrators" are notorious for their
orgies not only in the Solovky, but much further
afield — all over Northern Russia. The scene of
the debauches is usually Kem, where the Tchekists
from the monastery and from Popoff Island
assemble to make merry.
</p>

<p>
On Popoff Island itself they take place in the
quarters of Kirilovsky, the commandant of the
"Kemperraspredpunkt," who not long ago had the
reputation of being a decently conducted man.
They nearly always end in brawls.
</p>

<p>
For example, in August, 1924, a drinking-bout
of the usual kind was held in Kirilovsky's quarters.
Guests and host drank so heavily that Kirilovsky
felt ill, and they took him out into the fresh air.
When he returned to the house, the guests, as
drunk as pigs, were vomiting over the table, and
his wife was lying on a sofa in Popoff's arms in
a shameless posture.
</p>

<p>
Infuriated, Kirilovsky dragged Popoff from the
sofa and flung him away so violently that his head
went through the door. Popoff, however,
managed to give him a blow in the face, smashing
his glasses. Shots were fired. Popoff was dragged
out of Kirilovsky's quarters and taken home,
where he broke all the windows with his fists and,
shedding bitter tears, began to bellow so that all
the camp could hear him:
</p>

<p>
"They've killed me! They've killed me!"
</p>

<p>
It would appear that such a manner of life is
ideal Communism, for in November, 1924, at the
time of the anniversary of the October Revolution,
the Natchuslon received a letter of thanks from
the Moscow Gpu, in which the latter expressed
its gratitude to Nogteff and his colleagues for
"holding the banner of Communism aloft."
</p>

<p>
In the time which their alcoholic occupations
leave at their disposal, the "administrators" of
the Solovetsky Islands amuse themselves by
amnestying prisoners of the <i>shpana</i> category.
Every day, after navigation has begun, some five
hundred prisoners are released.
</p>

<p>
The procedure is as follows. The ordinary
criminals, male and female, are stripped of their
last rags ("State clothing"), are given railway
tickets to the towns where they live, and a supply
of bread in accordance with the length of their
journey. Then they are put into freight trucks
<i>stark naked</i>, and sent off to Kem station!
Naturally half the <i>shpana</i> rob somebody to get
clothes directly they arrive at Kem station, and
return to the camp to undergo an extra year's
imprisonment. The rest go away naked.
</p>

<p>
None of the "K.R.'s" are ever liberated. From
time to time it is rumoured that the politicals are
to be released or transferred to a prison on the
mainland of Russia. These rumours usually
remain rumours; if politicals leave the Solovky it
is only for another place of exile.

Bolshevist Hypocrisy — Prisoners for Life — The Student
Nikolaeff's Escape — Failure of other Attempts.
</i>
</p>

<p>
The foreign workmen who come to Moscow in
batches are given to understand by the Soviet
Government that it, of course, is against the
Solovky; it is willing to admit that the Solovky
are a discredit to the "humane" rule of the
workers and peasants. But, it asks, what is to be
done? —— the counter-revolutionaries continue
their struggle with the Soviet power, and so the
Gpu insists on the maintenance of the concentration
camps. The Gpu, for its part, puts the blame
on the Council of People's Commissaries.
</p>

<p>
And while they are saying this, the Council of
People's Commissaries and the Gpu are fettering
their prisoners to the Solovky and its "continuations"
<i>for their whole lives</i> — by sending them on
to other more or less remote places. Since the
autumn of 1924, by a special order of the Gpu —
submitted to and confirmed by the Vtsik — every
prisoner who has served his term in the Solovky is
sent for three years to a "free settlement" in the
Narym region, then to the Petchersk region for
three years more, then to the Turukhansk and
Zyriansk regions — that is to say, for twelve years
in all. For those who somehow or other contrive
not to die during these twelve years, a final reward
is reserved — exile to a permanent settlement in
Eastern Siberia.
</p>

<p>
Thus, whatever "offence" you have been found
guilty of, however you have conducted yourself
in the Solovky, you will <i>never</i> be released. Every
person transported by the Soviet Government is
doomed to die on his journeyings from prison to
prison, from one place of forced exile to another.
</p>

<p>
The terrible knowledge that one is a convict
for life, that, after the Solovky, one will be driven
off to new torments, be given a new Nogteff, a new
Kirilovsky, a new ration, be compelled to do more
hard labour, get into other "sacks," rot in another
Sekirka, makes the prisoner realise that this endless,
hopeless pilgrimage of pain must be cut short once
and for all — by escape.
</p>

<p>
But a successful escape from the Solovky is a
miracle, a fabulous piece of good fortune, granted
to a few out of scores of thousands.
</p>

<p>
During the time that I spent in the Solovky I
heard of only one case in which a prisoner had
escaped from the Solovky — and he did not escape
abroad, but into the interior of Russia. He was a
medical student named Nikolaeff — a "K.R." He
succeeded by some means or other in getting
himself employed as a clerk in the camp commandant's
office, and winning the confidence of the
Tchekists by pretended hatred of "K.R.'s." He
came to manage the whole business of the camp,
had all the forms and papers at his disposal, and
occasionally even went to Kem — without a guard!
— on business connected with the commandant's
office. He forged all the necessary documents for
himself — in an assumed name: a railway pass,
even a certificate of membership of the Communist
Party. Then he went to Kem, allegedly on
business — and never came back. Many weeks
later we got a letter saying that Nikolaeff was in
Moscow, sent us his kind remembrances, and
wished us a speedy departure southward.
</p>

<p>
Every other attempt to escape had invariably
ended in the fugitives being captured and put to
a torturing death. It was so with the Finlander
who tried to escape in March, 1925, and with
Captain Skhyrtladze's party. Six "K.R.'s,"
headed by Captain Skhyrtladze, escaped from the
Solovetsky Monastery in a boat which they had got
hold of after killing a sentry. For five days they
were tossed about in a rough sea, trying to make
the shore near Kem. They had no food, their
strength gave out, and several times the idea of
committing suicide by upsetting the boat presented
itself to them. At last one of the unhappy
Columbuses cried "Land!" They came to the
shore and landed at night. They were so weak
and exhausted that, having lit a fire in the woods,
they forgot everything else and fell down beside
it half dead. A patrol from the Solovky found
them there. The Tchekists flung bombs at the
fire. Four of the fugitives were killed on the
spot; the two others, one of whom was Captain
Skhyrtladze, were recaptured. Skhyrtladze had
one hand blown off and both legs broken. They
were taken to hospital, given some treatment, and
then, after cruel tortures, were shot.
</p>

<p>
Only a miracle, a direct act of God, could make
the impossible possible. But we — I and my four
comrades — believed in miracles, and prayed to
God for one. And He led us for thirty-five days
through the marshes of Karelia and the forests of
the border region, and on the thirty-sixth day
brought us to Kuusamo, in Finland.

Our Party Made Up — Elaborate Contrivance
Necessary — A Critical Moment.
</i>
</p>

<p>
The thought of escape was always in my mind,
even in the Caucasus, in the prisons of the
Extraordinary Commissions of Batoum, Tiflis,
Vladikavkaz and Grozny. On my arrival in the
Solovky, I first began to sound the possibilities in
this direction. In the concentration camps of the
north, inquiries of this kind have to be made with
extreme caution; the greatest delicacy must be
employed in asking questions and reconnoitring
the ground. You cannot tell which of the prisoners
are secret agents of the Gpu and which are people
who feel as you yourself do. There have been
many cases in which educated prisoners, at first
sight most charming fellows, have betrayed their
companions.
</p>

<p>
In the winter of 1924-25 I became intimate
with the medical student Nikolaeff. He told me
that he was making preparations to escape. We
did not agree, however, as to what should be done
in the next stage. Nikolaeff insisted that we
should escape into the interior of Russia, with
correct papers, which he promised to forge. As
described in the last chapter, he did this successfully
on his own behalf. I, on the contrary, was
for escaping abroad, for two reasons, viz.:
(1) even if we succeeded in escaping, the Tchekists
would probably find us very soon if we stayed in
Russia; (2) my destination, the Caucasus, was too
distant from the Solovky for me to be sure of
getting there. So, while Nikolaeff succeeded in
making his escape to Moscow <i>via</i> Kem and Petrograd,
I stayed in the Solovky to wait for a more
favourable opportunity.
</p>

<p>
One Saturday in February, 1925, a new convoy
of "K.R.'s" arrived in the Solovky. Among the
prisoners was a former captain in the Life Guards
Dragoon Regiment named Bezsonoff. He had
not been two days in the camp before he asked
me:
</p>

<p>
"What do you think about escaping? I mean
to clear off from here pretty soon."
</p>

<p>
As I had every reason to believe that I was
dealing with a Gpu spy, I replied:
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean to try to escape. I'm all right
here."
</p>

<p>
But soon I got to know Bezsonoff better. He
had been transported to Tobolsk for "counter-revolution"
and repeated attempts to escape from
captivity. He managed to escape from Tobolsk
and got to Petrograd, where he lived in freedom
for six months. Then he again fell into the hands
of the Gpu, which sentenced him to be shot, but
his sentence was commuted to five years in the
Solovky, to be followed by a period of exile in
the Narym region. In the camp he bore himself
with an independent air, openly abused the
Tchekists, and did not obey the orders of the
<i>personnel</i>.
</p>

<p>
We decided to escape into Finland. Each of us
sought for companions in the adventure among
our fellow-prisoners. Bezsonoff came to an
understanding with two Poles named Malbrodsky
and Sazonoff. Malbrodsky was a particularly
valuable comrade because he had a compass.
While in the Tcheka prison at Minsk, he had
hidden his compass in a cake of soap, and had
brought it, thus concealed, to the Solovky. Of
course we had no maps of any kind. Our marching
orders were simply — westward! Here the
compass would play a decisive part.
</p>

<p>
Only prisoners engaged in outside labour had
a chance of flight. Of late I had had the duty of
making out the lists of prisoners detailed for
various kinds of work outside the camp. I myself,
however, was not allowed by the Tchekists to go
outside the wire fence, as they had suspected me
for a long time past of intending to make a bolt.
I was faced with the difficult task of making out a
list of workers consisting only of men useful to
us, and getting my own name on to the list in
addition.
</p>

<p>
As a rule, parties from five to twelve strong are
detailed for work outside the camp. Too large a
party was no use to us. It was indispensable that
a party of five should be made up consisting of the
four already mentioned — Bezsonoff, Malbrodsky,
Sazonoff and myself — and a reliable "K.R." I
managed to add a Kuban Cossack to the list. He
was not warned in advance.
</p>

<p>
We had still one obstacle to overcome. Each
party was, as a rule, composed of prisoners
belonging to the same labour company. Bezsonoff
belonged to the 5th company, but Sazonoff, for
example, to the 7th. Although I was continually
in danger of ruining the whole laboriously contrived
scheme, I nevertheless managed to get all
our men into one party.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning of May 18th, 1925, two
parties, among others, were taken to work outside
the camp. A party from the 6th company was
taken to cut wood on the shore near Kem, and
another — ours — to clean out the Red soldiers'
barracks, on Popoff Island itself. This threatened
to ruin the whole plan — it was impossible to get
away from Popoff Island.
</p>

<p>
All this time a Tchekist named Myasnikoff had
been keeping a particularly watchful eye on me.
He sometimes said he had been a hussar, sometimes
a sailor, sometimes a colleague of Dzerzhinsky;
in the camp he was deputy-commander of a labour
regiment. I had, under his eyes, to invent some
reason for sending our party to the woods, and not
the other. After a minute's thought, I went up to
the party from the 6th company and said:
</p>

<p>
"You fellows'll be simply frozen in the woods
with such rags on, and only bast shoes. You'd
better go to the barracks."
</p>

<p>
Our men had specially mended their clothes and
boots for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
Luckily for us, just at this moment Myasnikoff
was called away for some reason or other. I led
our party up to the guards, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Now, comrades, take us off to work in the
woods."
</p>

<p>
Never has my heart beaten as it did in that
minute. They gave us an escort of two Red
soldiers, and took us off to work.

</h3>

<p class="pix40"> <i>
An Initial Success — Covering our Tracks — Bezsonoff
as Dictator — Traces of our Pursuers — A Trap.
</i>
</p>

<p>
We cut wood till 8 a.m. At that hour a goods
train came from Popoff Island to Kem; it would
have been dangerous to try to escape before then.
When the train had disappeared, Bezsonoff gave
the signal arranged long before — he turned up his
collar. We flung ourselves on the soldiers from
behind. We succeeded in disarming one of them
immediately. The other pushed away Malbrodsky
and Sazonoff, whose business it was to disarm him,
and began to yell. Luckily we were nearly three
miles from the camp. I gave the Red soldier a
blow in the side, and he fell.
</p>

<p>
I was for shooting the two soldiers; they were
both Communists and belonged to the Gpu troops.
But Bezsonoff persuaded me not to do so, arguing
that an act of vengeance at such a moment was
useless, and that no one would gain anything by it.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the Kuban Cossack, who had
flung himself on the ground in surprise, stretched
out his hands to us, and cried:
</p>

<p>
"Little brothers, don't kill me!"
</p>

<p>
We calmed him.
</p>

<p>
"What are you making all this noise about, you
fool? Nobody's going to kill you. The freedom
you had in the Solovky Kalinin gave you, we give
you the freedom you have now. Do as you like.
If you go back to the camp you'll be shot. If you
come with us, there's a risk there too. Or, if you
like, go south on your own, to the Kuban. We
can do without you. Do as you like."
</p>

<p>
The Cossack came with us. His name, by the
way, was Pribludin.
</p>

<p>
We had decided long before to cover our tracks
in every possible way. Our real objective being
the frontier between Russia and Finland, which lay
to westward, we went due north for twenty miles
along the railway embankment, taking the two Red
soldiers with us. After covering nine miles, we
sent one of the soldiers off in a westerly direction,
and the second when we had gone eleven miles,
first taking off their boots. We reckoned that
even if they found the way back they would not
reach the camp before the following morning.
</p>

<p>
We came to a railwayman's hut. We asked the
pointsman to sell us bread (we had six tchervontsy,
which we had saved while we were preparing to
escape), but the man, apparently a Communist,
refused. We had to take the food by force. We
loaded up Pribludin, Sazonoff and Malbrodsky
with the provisions and went on for three miles
in a northerly direction, then turned east, then
south, and came back almost to the same place from
which we had started northward two days before.
We crossed the railway embankment and steered
due west.
</p>

<p>
During these first days we walked without a
break, either by day or by, night. The "rests"
mentioned in Bezsonoff's diary, which he kept on
the inside of the cover of his Bible, were halts of a
few minutes only for food. Our weariness soon
began to make itself felt. There were no roads; our
route lay over damp ground, covered with thick
undergrowth, and endless marshes. Bezsonoff,
who had constituted himself an inexorable dictator
to the rest of us, brandished a rifle under the nose
of anyone who stopped even for a minute, and
threatened to kill him on the spot. At the
time we thought him cruel, but I know now
that the merciless insistence of our "dictator"
contributed in a high degree to the success of our
flight.
</p>

<p>
We changed direction sharply once again and
marched southward, towards the river Kem. A
snowstorm overtook us. The violence of the
tempest blew us off our legs. My boots got burnt
through at a fire; luckily I had an old pair of
goloshes with me, and put them on, winding strips
of rag round my legs. It is possible that the fearful
blizzard, which caused us such hardships, benefited
us at the same time, for the snow covered our
tracks.
</p>

<p>
Our bread was all finished. We had thirty bits
of sugar left. We had introduced a "starvation
ration," and were sharing out every crumb, when
we came to the hamlet Poddiujnoe.
</p>

<img src="images/page199_map.png" alt="Rough Map Showing our Route" />

<p>
Near the hamlet we found the footmarks of
Tchekists. As Bezsonoff had on a pair of Government
boots, taken from one of the Red soldiers, we
were able to compare the tracks and ascertain that
the footmarks were those of soldiers belonging to
the Gpu troops. We also found the footmarks of
police dogs. So we knew that we were being
hunted with dogs.
</p>

<p>
We decided to go on westward along the bank
of the river Kem, without making any detour.
My feet were so badly frost-bitten that the pain
sometimes brought tears into my eyes, but there
was nothing for it but to go on and on. About
ten miles from Poddiujnoe we met two Karelians.
On seeing us they were filled with horror at our
convict-like appearance, and at our situation. They
told us that all Karelia had been informed by
telephone that five men had escaped from the
Solovky, and ten poods of flour promised for each
fugitive handed over. They had seen ten
Tchekists with dogs. Moreover, a motor launch
from Kem, with six men on board, was patrolling
the river.
</p>

<p>
We asked the Karelians for bread and tobacco.
They gave us two loaves and a packet of <i>makhorka</i>
(coarse tobacco), for which we paid three roubles —
they had no change. They advised us to make for
a dairy farm twenty miles from Poddiujnoe. We
found, in due course, that a regular trap had been
laid for us at this dairy farm. But I do not think
the two Karelians sent us into it intentionally.
</p>

<p>
As a rule, when we came near a human habitation,
we lay on the ground for two hours, watching
to see who went into and came out of the house.
We did so this time, and saw nothing suspicious.
Sazonoff, Malbrodsky and Pribludin remained
behind, while Bezsonoff and I went forward. The
house stood apart from the farm buildings.
Bezsonoff opened the door. In the very act of
entering he gave a wild yell of "Red soldiers!"
On opening the door, he saw right in front
of him three rifles aimed at him. Being an
exceptionally cool-headed man, he did not lose his
head, but instantly slammed the door to and fired
through it.
</p>

<p>
I leapt to the door. The Red soldiers kept quite
still. It would have been stupid to fight them.
We decided to retreat to the woods. But we had
to pass the window of the house, and the Tchekists
would have shot us down from the window like
partridges. Bezsonoff took up a position close to
the stables, in a place from which he could fire at
the window at any moment if one of the soldiers
showed himself at it; I stood on the other side,
also holding my rifle at the ready.
</p>

<p>
Then, abandoning our posts, we gave ourselves
the order, "Quick — bolt!" and were about to
make for the woods when a motor launch, with six
soldiers on board, came up to the bank from the
direction of the mouth of the Shomba, a tributary
of the Kem. The Red soldiers in the house leapt
out of the windows on the opposite side, facing
the river. I did not see any use in firing. Bezsonoff,
however, fired at the launch. The Tchekists leapt
ashore and flung themselves into the woods.
Weeping and wailing arose from another boat,
loaded with women and children, the families of
Karelian fishermen. We retired hastily into the
woods.

</i>
</p>

<p>
We recommenced our exhausting journey through
the marshes, covered with thick scrub. We had
no food. Despair took the place of hope in our
hearts. Time after time we fell down from
exhaustion and weariness. My frost-bitten feet
caused me fearful torment.
</p>

<p>
We continued to follow the river Kem almost
due south, then turned west. Thus, falling and
getting up, and falling into the water again, we
covered twenty-five miles. We came to a big lake,
with fishermen's huts on the shore. The men were
not at home. We took a quantity of food and left
a tchervonets on a stone with a note which ran:
</p>

<p>
"We are sorry, but necessity compels us to steal.
We leave you a tchervonets."
</p>

<p>
For a long time we did not know how to get
across the lake. We tried to go round, and walked
ten miles — still we were confronted by water.
Then Sazonoff, who had grown up in the neighbourhood
of water, made some odd little rafts,
fastening planks together with everything we
had — rifle slings, belts, shirts — and brought us
over to the other side. This voyage across the lake,
I remember, used up what little energy we still
had. Indeed, when I now recall all that we went
through in those dreadful days, I cannot understand
how we endured such a strain, both physical
and mental, and how it was that we did not fall
down dead somewhere in the Karelian mosses. But
evidently God thought fit to save us, to bring us
out of the dense, marshy jungle, that we might
bear witness to the whole world of the place of
torment into which a loathsome government has
turned the once holy Solovetsky Monastery.
</p>

<p>
After crossing the lake, we decided to march due
west. More marshes in endless succession, no
paths, not a scrap of bread. We usually endured
the pangs of hunger for three days, and on the
fourth day went in search of bread, at the risk of
falling into a trap. While in search of provisions,
we came upon a wooden road through the marshes,
evidently laid down by the British. We could
see no tracks on it. We held a council of war, and
decided to turn off northward in the hope of
coming to a habitation. We covered twenty miles:
not a soul.
</p>

<p>
Then we came to another lake, and there, on the
other side, was a large village. We could hear
voices and the barking of dogs. We dragged
ourselves to the bank. Bezsonoff and Sazonoff
stood by the water's edge for a long time, and
shouted:
</p>

<p>
"Hallo! Hallo!"
</p>

<p>
At last we made ourselves heard. A boat came
over, rowed by a Karelian.
</p>

<p>
"Can we get any bread? We'll pay for it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you can get bread, you can get anything
you like," the honest fisherman replied. "But
there are Tchekists from the Solovky in the
village, searching for you."
</p>

<p>
Once more we had to plunge into the depths of
the scrub. It rained unceasingly, the days were
raw and windy. For four more days we had
nothing to eat. We had only our tobacco.
</p>

<p>
At last we came to a wooden footpath raised
above the water. We went along it and came to
a tiny hut in the middle of the marshes. We
examined the little place carefully, but could find
nothing eatable. While the rest of us were making
a fire of brushwood in the rain, Bezsonoff continued
to prospect in the neighbourhood of the hut, and
suddenly returned from his reconnaissance with
five loaves of black bread in his hands. He ate
greedily as he walked. I thought at first it was a
hallucination caused by hunger, but no, it was real
bread, and plenty of it!
</p>

<p>
It was evidently a hut belonging to Karelian
hay-makers. They bring their stores of food to
their huts in winter, because in summer it is
impossible to get to them; the marshes are turned
into an inland sea. Not far from our hut
Bezsonoff found a wooden shelter like a gigantic
mushroom, with an opening in the middle, and
under it exactly a hundred huge loaves, three bags
of groats and a bag of salt. Our joy knew no
bounds. We decided to have a good rest.
Happily, the possibility of a Tchekist ambush in the
midst of the marshes — the passage of which was
quite impracticable except by a footpath such as we
had found — could be almost entirely dismissed.
We made out of that bread (in fancy) tea, cooked
meat and various kinds of soup! We lived in the
hut until each of us had five cakes of bread left.
</p>

<p>
Then — westward once again! Water, water,
water without end. We marched for nearly a
week on the five cakes per man. We found a path,
which led us to a lonely dairy farm. We hid, kept
our ears open, and finally sent Sazonoff on to get
food. When he came back with bread and butter
we noticed that a peasant woman ran out of the
cottage and hurried to a boat which lay by the
bank. We had evidently come to a Communist's
house, and the woman had gone to fetch Red
soldiers. We fired a few shots after her; she took
fright and went back to the house.
</p>

<p>
We pillaged those Communists without mercy.
We took a tub of butter, a lot of white bread, and
all the fish there was in the house. We had now so
much food that even Bezsonoff and I, who usually
walked at the head of the party in "light marching
order," rifle in hand, had each of us to shoulder a
sack.
</p>

<p>
We were by this time simply in rags. The
thorny bushes had torn our clothes to shreds; our
boots had come unstitched. With tangled beards,
incredibly filthy faces, holes at knees and elbows,
we looked like cannibals, or escaped convicts —
which, for that matter, was just what we were.
</p>

<p>
Going along a narrow path through the woods,
we came upon tracks of Red soldiers' boots and the
stump of a <i>makhorka</i> cigarette. As we had no
tobacco left by then, we eagerly seized the stump,
and each of us had two puffs at it. Sazonoff and
Malbrodsky insisted that we should leave the
dangerous path. We came to a river. We looked
for a ford for over three hours, but could not
find one, and had to go back to the path we had
abandoned.
</p>

<p>
After we had walked for a long time we came to
a place where the marks of many feet were plainly
visible. We knew from this that we were quite
close to the frontier; but we could not say even
approximately where the frontier was. We had no
map, and none of us knew how many miles we had
to go to reach Finland. The arrow of the compass
showed us where west lay, and that was all.
</p>

<p>
We followed the tracks cautiously. We had
just gone round a slight hillock, when from behind
a big rock there came a hail of bullets. I was so
taken by surprise that I stopped dead. Fifty or
sixty rounds were fired at us point blank. We saw
the flashes from the rock. But not one of us was
touched. Not till then did we perceive that the
ambush was laid on both sides of the path. The
woods, particularly dense at that spot, saved us.
We scattered among the undergrowth. The firing
went on for a long time. It may have been the
Soviet frontier patrol we had encountered.
</p>

<p>
Moving swiftly westward, we came to a halt
again at the river. We could still find no ford.
We tried to find a way round; we went a long way
and came back again. We learnt a few days later
that this stream was the frontier between Russia
and Finland. It is considered impassable, and is,
therefore, guarded by neither Finlanders nor
Russians.
</p>

<p>
But cross the river we must; it blocked our route
westward. Sazonoff swam to the opposite bank.
Malbrodsky plunged into the water and began to
drown. The strong current swept him downstream;
I dragged him out with difficulty. I
myself was carried for several yards downstream;
I began to suffocate, but in the nick of time I stuck
the muzzle of my rifle into the river bottom and
supported myself on it. We did not know what
to do. We had no strength at all. We jumped
recklessly into the water several times, and every
time returned to the bank completely exhausted.
Then Sazonoff gave us another exhibition of his
skill in mastering any current; he carried each of us
in turn over to the opposite bank on his back!
</p>

<p>
This was at three o'clock on the morning of
June 15th.

<p>
We had not a dry thread on us. Our cartridges
were soaked. Our fingers shook with cold, we
could not speak to one another. To crown all, our
small supply of bread had run out. Luckily, a
couple of days later we came upon a deer in the
woods, and Bezsonoff, who had contrived, unlike
the rest of us, to keep his ammunition dry, shot it.
In our joy we ate half of it at once without bread.
We made soup out of a part of it, and took the
cooked meat that was left over along with us. The
result of this feast was that we all fell ill with an
acute gastric disorder, and for several days were
so weak that we could hardly walk.
</p>

<p>
After a long tramp we came, two days after we
had crossed the river, to a cottage. We went in
and asked the people to sell us bread and other
food. They could not speak or understand a word
of Russian. Supposing ourselves to be already in
Finland,<a href="#footnote35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> we repeatedly asked:
</p>

<p>
"Where are we? What is this? Finland?
Russians?"
</p>

<p>
We had recourse to mimicry, to talking on our
fingers. It was quite useless. (On arriving in
Finland, by the way, we discovered that the
Finnish name for the country is Suomi.)
</p>

<p>
We took some food of various kinds, and
offered them a tchervonets. They would not take
it. We gave them all our small change, ninety
silver kopeks; they took the silver. We went off,
followed by unfriendly looks.
</p>

<p>
Several more days passed, full of uncertainty.
Had we crossed the frontier or not? Were we in
Finland or still in the U.S.S.R.? If we assumed
the former to be the case, did we not risk making
our escape a failure after all the difficulties we had
overcome, and falling into the hands of the
Tchekists again?
</p>

<p>
On June 23rd we came to a big river. There
were a crowd of people on the opposite bank;
evidently wood-floating was in preparation. We
had noticed during the past week a certain change
in our surroundings, signs of order and culture;
and we had found a cigarette box with an inscription
that was not in Russian. The workmen on
the river bank were much better clothed than
Russian workmen are. After long hesitation and
uneasiness we decided that the frontier lay behind
us. We called for a boat to be sent from the other
side. The workmen who came across explained
to us, certainly not without difficulty, that the
U.S.S.R. lay far in our rear.
</p>

<p>
For a moment or two we could not utter a word
for mingled joy and weariness; all our strength
seemed suddenly to leave us. Bezsonoff chronicled
that unforgettable moment in his diary in one
significant word: "Finland."
</p>

<p>
Our "dictator" kept this diary on the inside of
the cover, the back of the table of contents, and
the last (440th) page of the "New Testament
of Our Lord Jesus Christ" (Synod edition of
1916). He made short pencil notes daily. These
disconnected entries, which had in truth been
through fire and water, give the clearest possible
picture of all the vicissitudes of our flight. It was
thanks to them that we did not lose count of the
days.
</p>

<p>
I give some typical extracts from Bezsonoff's
diary:

<p>
Bezsonoff evidently did not note all the days in
his diary, for in reality our flight came to an end
on June 23rd, 1925.
</p>

<p>
The Finlanders received us very kindly, gave us
food in abundance and sent us to Uleaborg. The
Chief of Police of Uleaborg moved us all to tears
by his attentions; he not only brought a quantity
of food to the prison for us, and supplied us with
money, but he took me himself to a doctor to have
my frost-bitten feet bound up. I, in outward
appearance a complete bandit, dirty and in rags,
felt strange in his smart carriage, and could read
on the faces of the people we met the dubious
query: "Who on earth is that convict in the Chief
of Police's trap?"
</p>

<p>
We were, however, not liberated immediately.
It appeared that the owner of the dairy farm from
which we had taken food a few days before, paying
for it with only about a rouble in silver (as the
people would not take our Soviet paper money),
had made a complaint against us, demanding
compensation to the amount of 1,000 marks. The
newspapers, privately informed of the occurrence,
wrote that "five Bolshevist bandits had crossed the
frontier and made an armed raid on a Finnish dairy
farm." While this affair was being settled, we
had to spend several weeks in prison, first at
Uleaborg and then at Helsingfors. But even
prison seemed paradise to us after the Solovky and
the Karelian jungles!
</p>

<p>
When we arrived at Helsingfors, the president
of the special committee for Russian affairs in
Finland, A. N. Fenoult, came to see us in prison.
Thanks to his extraordinary energy, and the infinite
trouble he took on our behalf, we were very soon
set at liberty, and were able to get ourselves decent
clothes and assume once more a human aspect. It
was significant that Malbrodsky (the other Pole,
Sazonoff, being a native of the former Government
of Vilna, was not recognised as being a Polish
subject), who had immediately appealed to the
Polish Consul, did not leave prison until later than
we, who had no official diplomatic protection.
</p>

<p>
I should like to conclude my simple narrative by
expressing our heartfelt gratitude to all, both
Finlanders and Russians, from whom, on our
arrival in Finland, we received so much kindness
and sympathy. After the ferocity shown by man
towards man in the concentration camps, after the
devastating egoism, the hardness, the inhuman
callousness, with which the Bolsheviks have
inoculated the unhappy Russian people, the
reception we met with in Finland touched us to the
bottom of our hearts.
</p>

<b>[35]</b> Language was not a certain guide, as the peasants on both sides of the
frontier are Finnish-speaking.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
